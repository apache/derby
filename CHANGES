Changes in Derby 10.2
    
 *) The Network Server no longer prints the message "Connection Number: N"
    to the console unless derby.drda.logConnections is set to true (DERBY-569)
    [ Bryan Pendleton ]

 *) The sysinfo tool now prints additional information about the origin of
    the classes and jars that it examines. The origin of a class might be:
    an entry in the application classpath, an entry in a class loader location
    list, a jar fetched due to being listed in the manifest entry of another
    jar, a standard extension in the JRE's extensions directory, a jar
    installed into the application server, or any of various other
    possibilities.

    Note that when sysinfo runs under a Java security manager, it may need
    special permissions to access this additional information, including the
    permission to read the java.class.path property, and the permission to
    call getProtectionDomain on a class. If sysinfo is not granted these
    permissions, it will display an error message about the security problem
    in place of displaying the class origin information.
