    These are the instructions for verifying the signed distributions. Probably you
    won't need to touch this section.

<releaseVerification>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and SHA-512 signatures.  SHA-512 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/db/derby/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>

<p>To verify the SHA-512 checksums on the files, you need to use a
platform-specific program. On Mac OSX, this program is called
<code>shasum</code>, on Linux it is called <code>sha512sum</code>,
and on Windows it is called <code>CertUtil</code>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and SHA-512.</p>
