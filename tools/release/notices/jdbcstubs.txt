The JDBC apis for small devices and JDBC3 (under java/stubs/jsr169 and
java/stubs/jdbc3) were produced by trimming sources supplied by the
Apache Harmony project. In addition, the Harmony SerialBlob and
SerialClob implementations are used. The following notice covers the Harmony sources:

Portions of Harmony were originally developed by
Intel Corporation and are licensed to the Apache Software
Foundation under the "Software Grant and Corporate Contribution
License Agreement", informally known as the "Intel Harmony CLA".
