1. General
**********
These scripts are based on a directory structure where

TESTEXECUTIONDIR (defined in the testenv.sh) specifies where
tests are executed, and thus where Derby logs and db-files etc. are
initially placed, and

DERBYDIR (defined in env.sh) specifies where we place dirs and files
keeping info on update, build and final test reports.

In our environment we execute tests (via rsh/ssh) on a set of hosts
listed in HOSTLISTFILE(defined in env).

The list of Derby svn revisions we have tested are kept in
REVISIONLIST(defined in env).

'env' is a "definition" script which is sourced by most other scripts.
All scripts must also be told where 'env' and other scripts are found:
TOOLDIR="${DERBYDIR}/${BRANCH_DIR}/tools/testing/reporting/scripts"



2.Update, build, test.
*********************
I use a script 'updateBuildTestDerby' to initiate the full update,
build, test sequence.

First we define the Derby update and build environement by sourcing
'env.sh' which we have in ${DERBYDIR}.
'testenv.sh' defines the Derby test environment.
${DERBYDIR}.) 


2.1. ${TOOLDIR}/updateDerby
---------------------------
NB! assumes 'derby_source' is defined. (In our case that would
actually be ${DERBYDIR}/trunk.)

'updateDerby' creates update status files in ${UPDATELOGDIR}.
If the update was successful ${REVISIONLIST} is updated and
${UPDATELOGDIR}/updateOK is created to flag succesful update.

The script may also send mail to inform of the update status
(${TOOLDIR}/textMail). 


2.2. ${TOOLDIR}/buildDerby
--------------------------
NB! assumes 'derby_source' is defined. 

If ${UPDATELOGDIR}/updateOK exists we will build Derby.

We do 'ant clobber', 'ant all' and 'ant buildjars'.

'buildDerby' creates build status files in ${BUIDLOGDIR}.
${BUILDLOGDIR}/builOK is created to flag succesful build.

The script may also send mail to inform of the build
status(${TOOLDIR}/textMail).


2.3. Run tests
--------------
${TOOLDIR}/testDerby ${HOSTLISTFILE} uses rsh/ssh to call
${TOOLDIR}/startDerbyTests on all test hosts in ${HOSTLISTFILE}.
(In our env. I haven't been able to automatically do this via rsh to
CYGWIN hosts yet ....)

${TOOLDIR}/startDerbyTests essentially calls ${TOOLDIR}/runAllTests
which is the main script for running tests and collecting initial test
results.

${TOOLDIR}/runAllTests takes 
1) a file listing Derby test suites to be run and 
2) the full path to where test results are put.

${TOOLDIR}/runAllTests creates the following files which are used by
the scripts creating the web presentation:
SUITESLOG="${TESTLOG_PLATF_DIR}/${REVISION}.csv"
JAVAINFO="${TESTLOG_PLATF_DIR}/${REVISION}.javainfo"
CURRSUITESLOG="${TESTLOG_PLATF_DIR}/current.csv"
PREVSUITESLOG="${TESTLOG_PLATF_DIR}/previous.csv"
LOG="${TESTLOG_PLATF_DIR}/${REVISION}.txt"
The *.csv files are essentially a summary from the Derby test harness
${suite}_report.txt files.

When the test suites run on a platform is finished the script may send mail
to inform of the result. (${TOOLDIR}/textMail). 


The *.csv files are a simple textual summary of the test results per
platform tested. These are actually what I started out with before
adding the web presentation.
