Project Status

  Description

  "Derby" began as a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational database.
  IBM contributed the code to The Apache Software Foundation and
  bases future versions of IBM Cloudscape on the Apache-managed code.

  To participate in Derby, you should join the mailing list. Just
  send an empty message to derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org.

  Derby graduated from incubation in July, 2005 and is now a
  full-fledged Apache DB project..


Project info

  * The Apache DB project owns the Derby subproject, and the subproject
    follows the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant contributors to this sub-
    project (for example, after a significant interval of sustained
    contribution) will be proposed for commit access to the codebase.

  * The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and discrete
    downloads.
