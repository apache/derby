Incubator Status

  Description

  "Derby" is a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational database. IBM is
  opening the code by contributing it to The Apache Software Foundation and 
  basing future versions of IBM Cloudscape on the Apache-managed code.

  To participate in the Derby podling, you should join the mailing list. Just 
  send an empty message to derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org .

  The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a viable 
  developer community around the codebase.

  The second goal of Derby-in-incubation is to successfully produce a release. 
  Since Derby is in incubation, such a release would not have formal standing; 
  it will serve as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate to the developers' and 
  incubator's satisfaction that this aspect of the project is health and 
  understood.

Project info

  * The Apache DB project will own the Derby subproject, and the subproject will
    follow the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant contributors to this sub-
    project (for example, after a significant interval of sustained
    contribution) will be proposed for commit access to the codebase.

  * The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and discrete downloads.

Incubation work items

Project Setup

Identify the codebase

date        item
2004-08-30  If applicable, make sure that any associated name does not already
            exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not
            already trademarked for an existing software product.
DONE        If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external
            package, then ask the Apache project for the cvs module and mail
            address names.
DONE        If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project,
            then post a message to that project for them to decide on 
            acceptance.
N/A         If request from anywhere to become a stand-alone PMC, then assess
            the fit with the ASF, and create the lists and modules under the
            incubator address/module names if accepted.

Copyright

date        item
2004-08-26  Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF
            been received. It is only necessary to transfer rights for the
            package, the core code, and any new code produced by the project.
2005-01-10  Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been
            updated to reflect the new ASF copyright.

Verify distribution rights

date        item
2004-10-12  Check that all active committers have a signed CLA on record.
2004-10-12  Remind active committers that they are responsible for ensuring that
            a Corporate CLA is recorded if such is is required to authorize
            their contributions under their individual CLA.
2004-10-12  Check and make sure that for all items included with the
            distribution that is not under the Apache license, we have the right
            to combine with Apache-licensed code and redistribute.
2004-10-12  Check and make sure that all items depended upon by the project is
            covered by one or more of the following approved licenses: Apache,
            BSD, Artistic, MIT/X, MIT/W3C, MPL 1.1, or something with

Establish a list of active committers !

status  item
DONE    Check that all active committers have submitted a contributors
        agreement.
DONE    Add all active committers in the STATUS file.
DONE    Ask root for the creation of committers' accounts on cvs.apache.org.

Infrastructure !

status	item
DONE	Ask infrastructure to create source repository modules and grant the
        committers karma.
DONE    Ask infrastructure to set up and archive Mailing lists.
DONE    Decide about and then ask infrastructure to setup an issuetracking
        system (Bugzilla, Scarab, Jira).
DONE    Migrate the project to our infrastructure.

Generally, the result of checking off these items will be a Software Grant, CLA,
and Corporate CLA for ASF licensed code, which must have no dependencies upon
items whose licenses that are incompatible with the Apache License.

Licensing awareness

DONE - Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and
       acknowleged by all committers?

PENDING ISSUES
==============

None.

RESOLVED ISSUES SINCE LAST STATUS
=================================

[VOTE] Re-vote for Derby docs in DITA format

  Jeff Levitt called for a vote to to decide whether to use DITA source files
  for the Derby documentation, or to continue to look for other options.
  This would allow us the project to create PDF's, single html files for each
  document, or dynamically update indexes as opposed to the current HTML source.

  Passed with seven +1 votes.

[VOTE] Reject tally of logo votes

  Due to irregularities in the voting for the Derby Logo Contest, Jean
  Anderson called for a vote to reject the tally of votes and restart
  the contest at a later date.

[VOTE] to accept Derby Network Client contribution

  On April 18, 2005, Satheesh Bandaram announced the availability of a new
  open source Network Client Driver for the Derby Network Server, replacing
  the need to use the IBM DB2 Universal JDBC Driver (JCC) as the client to
  connect to the Derby Network Server.

  Passed with nine +1 votes.

[VOTE] Network client driver should match embedded where possible for
       implementation specific behaviour.

  In order to create a seamless transition from embedded to client, Kathey
  Marsden called for a vote to agree that the client driver behavior should be
  changed to match the embedded wherever possible.

  Passed with ten +1 votes.

[VOTE] to accept Derby UI and Help plugins for Eclipse

  On May 13, 2005, Rajesh Kartha announced that the source for the UI components
  for Eclipse that had been previously available as the IBM Integration plugin
  for Derby would be contributed to the Derby project and called for a vote to
  accept it.

  Passed with three +1 votes.

[VOTE] to accept Tomohito Nakayama as a committer
  Passed with +1 votes from Jeremy Boynes, Jean T Anderson,
  Satheesh Bandaram, Brian McAllister, Mike Matrigali,
  Andrew McIntyre, Kathey Marsden
