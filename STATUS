Incubator Status

  Description

  "Derby" is a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational
  database. IBM is opening the code by contributing it to The Apache
  Software Foundation and basing future versions of IBM Cloudscape on
  the Apache-managed code.

  To participate in the Derby podling, you should join the mailing
  list. Just send an empty message to derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org .

  The initial goal of the project while in incubation is to build a
  viable developer community around the codebase.

  The second goal of Derby-in-incubation is to successfully produce a
  release.  Since Derby is in incubation, such a release would not
  have formal standing; it will serve as a proof-of-concept to
  demonstrate to the developers' and incubator's satisfaction that
  this aspect of the project is health and understood.

Project info

  * The Apache DB project will own the Derby subproject, and the
    subproject will follow the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant
    contributors to this sub- project (for example, after a
    significant interval of sustained contribution) will be proposed
    for commit access to the codebase.

  * The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and
    discrete downloads.

2004-08-30  If applicable, make sure that any associated name does not
            already exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure
            that the name is not already trademarked for an existing
            software product.

            the ASF been received. It is only necessary to transfer
            rights for the package, the core code, and any new code
            produced by the project.
2004-11-04  Check and make sure that the files that have been donated
            have been updated to reflect the new ASF copyright.

            MPL 1.1, or something with essentially the same terms.

Generally, the result of checking off these items will be a Software
Grant, CLA, and Corporate CLA for ASF licensed code, which must have
no dependencies upon items whose licenses that are incompatible with
the Apache License.

PENDING ISSUES
==============

Derby documentation in PDF format:

  A request was made for PDF documentation, however, the source files
  for the current HTML documentation for Derby are not in a form
  useful for creating PDF documentation with Forrest. A proposal was
  made by Jeff Levitt <jlevitt@mutagen.net> to convert the
  documentation into XML DITA format.

  The Getting Started and Reference Manual were converted to DITA and
  are available for review from
  http://incubator.apache.org/derby/manuals/index.html
 
RESOLVED ISSUES SINCE LAST STATUS
=================================

[VOTE] Network Server XAMGR Level Support

  Kathey Marsden submitted a patch for adding XA Support to the Network 
  Server. It received three +1 votes, and was committed as revision 123827
  to the trunk.

[VOTE] Intersect and Except

  Jack Klebanoff submitted a patch adding support for SQL INTERSECT and EXCEPT
  The patch received four +1 votes and was committed to the trunk as revision
  124467.

[VOTE] Java routine signature support - Derby 89

  Jeremy Boynes submitted a patch that is a first step to adding Java method
  signature support for Java routines. The patch received one +1 vote, and
  no vetoes, so the patch was committed to the trunk as revision 124819.

[VOTE] JDBC 2.0 Updatable Result Sets

  Mamta Satoor submitted a patch to support the delete functionality of JDBC
  2.0 Updatable Result Sets. After some discussion, the patch was committed
  as revision 125266 to the trunk.

OTHER NEWS
==========

A branch has been created based on the 10.0.2.1 release. To check out the
branch, use the following Subversion URL:

svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/derby/code/branches/10.0

The Derby trunk is now versioned 10.1.0.0 alpha. The trunk is not suitable
for production use. Please see the warning at 
http://incubator.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html in the "Derby source
code" section.

The Derby Code contest at ApacheCon received several entries. Details on the
entries and winners can be found here:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=derby-dev@db.apache.org&msgId=2006536

Kathy Saunders announced that IBM would contribute a new Derby Network
Server client driver to Derby, to replace the need to use the IBM 
Universal JDBC Driver, or JCC, to connect to Derby Network Server.
Since the last update to STATUS, tests, scripts, and demo applications for
Derby have also been contributed.
