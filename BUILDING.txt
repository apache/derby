---------------------------------------------------------------
2     Downloads

Prior to building derby source code, download derby source
code and required software as following:



2.1   Download source code

Create a new directory and download derby source code in 
this directory. This directory will be referred to as the 
${derby.source} directory in the rest of this document. 

After downloading source code to directory ${derby.source},
there should be the following files and directories:

${derby.source}/build.xml 
${derby.source}/bin
${debry.source}/java 
${derby.source}/maven
${derby.source}/plugins
${derby.source}/tools 


2.2   Download required software

This section lists all the required software for Derby
build environment.

Notes:
----- 
(1) The Derby build environment requires you to install two levels of 
    the Java Development Kit (JDK) - Java 5 and JDK 1.4.x.
    Java 5 is needed to compile language features introduced by Java 5.
    JDK 1.4.x  is needed because Derby is designed 
    to work in JDK 1.4.x (JDBC 3.0) environments (or higher).
    The Derby build is set up such that most of 
    the code is compiled against JDK 1.4.x libraries. This ensures that
    no run-time dependencies on higher levels of the JDK exist. Optional
    run-time code can take advantage of Java 5 language features.
    If the Java 6 JDK is present, the build will also compile optional
    support for JDBC 4.

(2) The Derby build environment is tested with Sun's Java 5 compiler,
    with Sun's JDK 1.4.2 libraries, and with Ant 1.6.1.
    The Derby build environment
    should work with other versions and other sources of 
    Java 5 and  JDK 1.4 (1.4.x) and with other versions of Ant 1.6 (1.6.x).



2.2.1 Download and install Apache Ant 1.6.3 or higher

(1) Download a binary distribution of Ant from:
         http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

(2) Install Ant in any directory. This 
    directory will be referred to as ${ant.dir} 
    directory in the rest of this document. 


2.2.2 Download and install Java Development Kits

Skip steps 1-2 of this section if you already have JDK 1.4.x 
installed on your system.  

(1) Download JDK 1.4.x. 
    The reference implementation is available at:
       http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

    For MacOS X, get the latest download from:
       http://developer.apple.com/java/download

(2) Install JDK 1.4.x according to the instructions included 
    with the release in any directory. 

(3) The directory where you have installed JDK 1.4.x will be 
    referred to as ${jdk14.dir} in the rest of this document.

You must also install the Java 5 (or later) JDK and this must be the version of
Java used by the ant process in which you run the Derby build. You
may skip steps 4-5 of this section if you have already installed
Java 5 or a later version of the JDK.

(4) Download the Java 5 or later JDK.
    The reference implementation is available at:
       http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp

    For MacOS X, get the latest download from:
       http://developer.apple.com/java/download

(5) Install the Java 5 JDK according to the instructions included 
    with the release in any directory. 

(6) The directory where you have installed the Java 5 JDK will be 
    referred to as ${java5.dir} in the rest of this document.

2.2.3 Download and install JUnit 3.8.*

(1) JUnit is needed for some of Derby's tests. Download a JUnit 3.8.1
    from

      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/junit/junit3.8.1.zip?download

    Note that http://junit.org only has the latest version of JUnit
    which may not work until we fix the Derby build to accomodate 
    the 1.5 extensions to java.

(2) Unzip the JUnit zip file and place junit.jar from the zip file into
    ${derby.source}/tools/java.


2.2.4 Optional - Download and install Java 6 Development Kit (JDK) 


Skip steps 1-2 of this section if you already have the Java 6 JDK
installed on your system.

(1) Download the Java 6 JDK
    This is available at http://java.sun.com/javase/6/
  

(2) Install Java 6 JDK according to the instructions in any directory. 

    Verify that bin/javac(.exe) exists under the JDK install directory.

(3) The directory where you have installed the Java 6 JDK will be 
    referred to as ${jdk16.dir} in the rest of this document.


2.2.5 Optional - Download J2ME/CDC/Foundation and JSR 169 jars

Derby's embeded engine supports J2ME/CDC/Foundation 1.0 using the JDBC
sub-set defined in JSR 169. In order to build Derby to
support this platform, jars are needed for the Foundation 1.0
profile and the JSR169 JDBC subset. There is no standard place
for these jars yet, possible downloads are:

java.sun.com/j2me
IBM's WCTME 5.7

Once you have obtained these jars and set the jsr169compile.classpath
(see section 3.2) the regular Derby builds will include the JSR169 code
for the embedded engine. The resulting jar file (derby.jar) can be used
on J2ME, or J2SE, write once run anywhere.



Note: After following the steps in sections 2.2.3-2.2.5 of this
document, you should have the following:

${derby.source}/tools/java/empty.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/geronimo-spec-servlet-2.4-rc4.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/javacc.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/junit.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/felix.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/xercesImpl.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/xml-apis.jar

---------------------------------------------------------------
3     Build instructions


3.1   Set Required Environmental Variables

(1) Create environment variable ANT_HOME  to point to the 
    directory where you have installed Ant. For example:

     setenv ANT_HOME ${ant.dir} -- On unix(csh)
     export ANT_HOME=${ant.dir} -- On unix(ksh)
     set ANT_HOME=${ant.dir}    -- On Windows

(2) Modify the PATH environment variable to include the 
    directory ${ant.dir}/bin in its list. This makes the "ant" 
    command line script available, which will be used to 
    actually perform the build. 

(3) Create environment variable JAVA_HOME  to point to the 
    directory where you have installed the Java 5 (or later)
    JDK. For example:

     setenv JAVA_HOME ${java5.dir} -- On unix(csh).
     export JAVA_HOME=${java5.dir} -- On unix(ksh)
     set JAVA_HOME=${java5.dir}    -- On Windows


3.2   Create property file

On many platforms, you can skip this section if you are happy with the
defaults which the Derby build provides. However, please consult this
section if the Derby build fails on your platform or if you want to
override the build defaults. By editting the ant environment file
(called ant.properties and located in your home directory, or an optional
file called local.properties in the top of the source tree), you can
override the following defaults:

- The location of the compiler libraries for jdk 1.4 and Java 5.
   Some effort has been put into figuring out where these libraries
   live, based on the platform you are using and the vendor who
   supplied your VM. The following combinations of VMs and
   operating systems should work out-of-the-box:

   * Apple JDKs on Mac OS X
   * Sun and IBM JDKs on  Linux
   * Sun and IBM JDKs on Windows/Cygwin
   * Sun JDKs on Solaris

- The location of the Java 6 environment needed to build the
   optional JDBC4 support.

- The compiler to be used.

- Whether the build should continue after stumbling over an error.

- Whether to omit debug information from compiled classes.

- The location of the small device libraries needed to build the
  optional JSR169 support.

- The location of old versions of Derby needed to run the upgrade
   tests.

If you are happy with the defaults, you can skip this section and
proceed to section 3.3.

Otherwise, you will need to create a property file to specify
your environment and some of your options. Do the following
to specify your environment and options:

(1) Determine the directory on your system that corresponds to
    the "user.home" system property of the JVM referred to by
    JAVA_HOME. This directory will be referred to as the 
    ${user.home} directory in the rest of this document. 
    In order to determine the correct value of ${user.home}, 
    you can do either of the following:

	a) Run ant diagnostics and look for "user.home" in the
           list of System properties:
		
           ant -diagnostics

	b) Write and run a small java program that prints the
           value of the "user.home" system property, e.g. by
           including the following line in the program:

           System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
           
    On Unix systems, ${user.home} is often equivalent to the
    value of the environment variable $HOME or $home.
    On newer Windows systems, ${user.home} is often equivalent
    to the value of the environment variable %USERPROFILE%.

    NOTE: It is not a requirement that ant.properties reside in your
    user.home directory. The file can be placed anywhere accessible
    on the local filesystem, but ant must then be invoked with the
    -propertyfile option:

    ant -propertyfile {path_to_propertyfile}

(2) Create a file called "ant.properties" in your ${user.home} 
    directory and define the following variables in 
    "ant.properties".

    NOTE TO CYGWIN USERS: Put this in your *Windows* home directory,
    not your Cygwin home directory.

    NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: *use forward slashes* ("/") in your
    path specifications.  Backward-slashes ("\") confuse Ant.
    Check your path specifications for correct use of slashes in 
    ant.properties if you get errors during the build saying java.lang 
    can not be found.

    For example, you should have:

      j14lib=c:/jdk1.4.2/jre/lib

    NOT
 
      j14lib=c:\jdk1.4.2\jre\lib

   
    - j14lib

      This is a required variable which defines the location of
      JDK 1.4.x. Define the variable as follows:

          j14lib=${jdk14.dir}/jre/lib
      
      where ${jdk14.dir} is the directory name where you have 
      installed JDK 1.4.x. Check out section 2.2.2 of this document. 

    - j15lib

      This is a required variable which defines the location of
      JDK 1.5.0. Define the variable as follows:

          j15lib=${jdk15.dir}/jre/lib
      
      where ${jdk15.dir} is the directory name where you have 
      installed JDK 1.5.0. Check out section 2.2.2 of this document. 

    - Optional - jdk16

      This specifies the location of your Java 6 JDK install directory.
      This is only needed if you want to build the code specific to
      Java 6 (e.g. JDBC 4 classes)


    - java14compile.classpath - IBM JVMs only

      IBM Java SDKs may be used in place of Sun's, but IBM packages
      its Java runtime libraries in multiple jar files instead of
      a single jar file, rt.jar. This means that if you are using
      IBM SDKs to provide your Java runtime environment, you need to
      also override the property java14compile.classpath in your 
      ant.properties file to account for the difference in
      packaging. Define the variable as follows:

      java14compile.classpath=${j14lib}/core.jar;${j14lib}/server.jar;${j14lib}/xml.jar;${j14lib}/ibmjcefw.jar;${j14lib}/security.jar
      
    - build.compiler

      This variable defines the java compiler to be used for build. 
      The default value of this variable is set to use the 'modern' java 
      compiler for build. The default 'modern' compiler will be the one
      from the JDK used to run ant, typically from the setting of JAVA_HOME.
      One can determine which JDK ant is using by running ant -verbose
      and looking for the line that starts with:
        Detected Java version:
      early in the output.  

    - proceed

      This variable directs Ant to proceed past any build errors and  
      complete rest of the build (when set to true) or stop build any 
      time an error is found (when set to false). The default value 
      for this variable is false. You can overwrite default value 
      by setting it to true by defining the variable as following: 

           proceed=true

    - sane

      By default this variable is set to true and builds
      extra asserts and debugging information in the class
      files. When set to false no extra asserts or debugging 
      information is included in the class files, making Derby
      run faster as it generates smaller class files.
      You can overwrite default value by setting it to false by
      defining the variable as following: 

          sane=false

      Typically applications embedding Derby would use jar files 
      built with sane=false.

    - Optional - jsr169compile.classpath

      If you downloaded the J2ME jar files (section 2.2.5) then
      setting this property will enable the optional JSR169 targets
      for the top-level default, engine or all targets.
      The compile classpath needs to include the Foundation 1.0
      and JSR169 environments, see any documentation for your
      source of J2ME libraries. Here is an example for IBM's WCTME 5.7
 
      jsr169compile.classpath=C:/wctme5.7/ive/lib/jclFoundation10/classes.zip;C:/wctme5.7/ive/lib/jdbc.jar

      
    - Optional - derbyTesting.jar.path
    
      This property is required to run upgrade tests. Set this property 
      to point to the location of jar files from a previous release from 
      which we need to test upgrade. This property needs to be set only if 
      the source files will not be available when running tests. In this case,
      the jars can be copied to any location with the following relative path 
      ${jar_location}/{majorversion.minorversion}. The property should be set 
      as follows:
      
      derbyTesting.jar.path=${jar_location}
      
      If the test is run on the machine where the source files from svn have
      been built, then it is not required to set this property. The jars checked
      into svn will be used. If the tests are being run in a location where the
      jars from the previous release are available in a different location
      than where the source files for the upgrade tests have been built, the 
      following property needs to be set on the command line for RunSuite or
      RunTest where the tests are being run:

      -Djvmflags=-DderbyTesting.jar.path={path_to_derby_jars}

      where {path_to_derby_jars} points to a directory where the jars for the
      previous Derby release being tested for upgrade reside in a subdirectory
      named according to the major.minor version. For example:

      If the Derby 10.1 jars for upgrade testing reside in
      /opt/testing/derby/10.1 then the command line needed for the upgrade
      tests to complete would include the following:

      java -Djvmflags=-DderbyTesting.jar.path=/opt/testing/derby \
           org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite upgrade

      Please note that if you change the value of derbyTesting.jar.path
      you will need to remove the file org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Upgrade_10_1_10_2.properties
      from your build output directory and run 'ant all' for the updated value 
      of the property to be written into that generated file.

      
      
3.3   Run Derby build

(1) Go to directory ${derby.source}.

(2) Run the following command to start build:
     
    >ant

    The above command will build all classes into
    ${derby.source}/classes. If you add this directory
    in your classpath, you will have full functionality
    of engine, tools, and network server. 

    In addition, if you would like to build the Derby test
    framework and related files, run the following command:

    >ant testing

    NOTE ABOUT building JDBC4: The JDBC4 class files have
    dependencies on the Java 6 JDK.  However, to build for JDBC4, do NOT
    set your JAVA_HOME to the Java 6 JDK.  Instead, set it
    to your standard JDK 1.4 or JDK 1.3 location.  In your ant.properties,
    make sure you set jdk16 as described in section
    3.2 (2), and that is all you need to do.


(3) Run the following command to build all jars:
    
    >ant buildjars

    The above command will build the following jar files:
    - derby.jar (database engine), 
    - derbytools.jar (utilities: sysinfo, dblook, ij) 
    - derbynet.jar (network server).
    - derbyLocale_*.jar (13 jar files with locale support).
    - derbyclient.jar (derby network client)
    If the tests were built, the following jar file will also be built:
    - derbyTesting.jar (the test framework and related files)

    You can run the ant command to build an individual jar
    file as following:
    - command "ant derbyjar" to build derby.jar
    - command "ant derbytoolsjar" to build derbytools.jar
    - command "ant derbynetjar" to build derbynet.jar
    - command "ant derbylocalejars" to build the derby locale jar files.
    - command "ant derbytestingjar" to build derbyTesting.jar
    - command "ant derbyclientjar" to build derbyclient.jar

Notes: 
(1) The estimated total time for build completion is ~5-10 minutes.

(2) Derby build environment is NOT dependency based build environment.
    Make sure to check out explaination of "clobber" target in
    section 4.1 of this document.



3.4   Verify Derby build

To verify if the Derby build was successful, do the
following:

(1) Run "ant" command again and nothing should happen. No 
    files should get compiled, copied or generated. 

(2) Check if the following directories were created:
      - ${derby.source}/classes
      - ${derby.source}/jars if you have built the 
        jars in step 3 of section 3.3

(3) Execute the following command:
    
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/classes org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    You can also execute one of the following commands if you 
    have built the jars in step 3 of section 3.3:

    For builds with sane=true
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/sane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/sane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    For builds with sane=false
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/insane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/insane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    The above commands should report the system info and output 
    should look like the following:

    ------------------ Java Information ------------------
    Java Version:    1.4.1_07
    Java Vendor:     Sun Microsystems Inc.
    Java home:       C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_07
    Java classpath:  c:\derby\classes
    OS name:         Windows 2000
    OS architecture: x86
    OS version:      5.0
    Java user name:  derbyuser
    Java user home:  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator
    Java user dir:   C:\derby
    --------- Derby Information --------
    [C:\derby\classes] 10.0.2.0 - (1)
    ------------------------------------------------------
    ----------------- Locale Information -----------------
    ------------------------------------------------------


(4) Execute the following command:
    
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/classes org.apache.derby.tools.ij 

    You can also execute one of the following commands if you 
    have built the jars in step 3 of section 3.3:

    For builds with sane=true
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/sane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/sane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.ij 

    For builds with sane=false
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/insane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/insane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.ij 
                
   
(5) Execute the following statement: 

    connect 'jdbc:derby:test;create=true'; 

    The above statement should create and connect to a 
    database with no errors.


(6) Derby also includes a suite of tests for more comprehensive verification.
    Information on how to run these tests can be found in the source tree,
    in the file ${derby.source}/java/testing/README.htm

---------------------------------------------------------------
4     Derby build miscellaneous information

This section provides miscellaneous information about
Derby builds. 



4.1   Derby build targets

Some of the main targets that can be called as
"ant targetname" are as the  following:

  all: builds the source code, demos, and tests.

  buildsource: to build source code. This is default target.

  demo: builds the simple demos in java/demo

  testing: builds the tests in java/testing. For additional information on
           testing, please see java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/README.htm

  javadoc: to create javadoc for all source code.

  publishedapi: to create javadoc for application api classes.

  buildjars: to create jar files

  clobber: remove all built objects except jars. You should run
           this target if you have source code upgrade or
           you changed the source code and you are getting
           some errors.

  clean: remove output directory (${derby.source}/classes)

  cleanjars: remove jars directory (${derby.source}/jars)

  cleandocs: remove javadoc directory (${derby.source}/javadoc)

  plugin:  creates a zip file, derby_eclipse_plug-in.zip, in the 
           jars/insane directory.  The plugin target depends on the 
           default ant target.  This creates the Core plug-in only.


4.2   Derby source code upgrade

After upgrading derby source code, do the following before 
building the code as per instructions given in section 3.3:

(1) Go to directory ${derby.source}.

(2) Run the following command to clean up:

    >ant clobber



4.3   Derby Build flow

This section provides the information on Derby build flow.
This section can be skipped unless you are really interested
in learning about Derby build flow.
    
Initially, Ant generates state.properties. This file contains 
a single property, sanity, with a boolean value that determines 
the sanity state of the build. 'Sanity' was a concept introduced 
early in Cloudscape as a way of having assert functionality 
in the code before Java actually supported such functionality 
syntactically. It was a way to keep development 'sane,' 
thus the name. Assertions are contained in an if-block based 
on the static final boolean values SanityState.DEBUG or 
SanityState.ASSERT, which are true in a sane (debug) build, 
and false in an insane (non-debug/optimized) build. 
Therefore, in an insane build, a smart compiler will not 
write the code in the if-block into the classfile, since 
it would never be run. 

The source file containing the static final boolean values of the
sanity state, org.apache.derby.iapi.services.sanity.SanityState 
is then generated from a template. The sanity state defaults to 
true. This also directs the compiler to turn on all debugging 
options on the compiler. The sanity state can be set to insane 
by running 'ant insane' or passing in the value -Dsane=false.
Note that this file will be removed after 'ant clobber,' so if
you are rebuilding from scratch and want the build to be a
non-debug build, run 'ant insane' before building.

Once the sanity state has been generated, Ant prints out for 
reference the current properties that affect the build, 
including base directory, output directory, compiler, 
sanity state, and the value of the java property 'proceed.' 
 
Next, the parser files are generated with JavaCC. Once the parser 
files have been generated, the compilation of the source files 
begins. The source is compiled in a specific order, that order 
being: reference, internal API, public API, implementation. 
At the end of the build, the properties files containing the 
message files are copied into the output directory and the 
version information properties files are generated.
