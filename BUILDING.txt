---------------------------------------------------------------
2     Downloads

Prior to building derby source code, download derby source
code and required software as following:



2.1   Download source code

Create a new directory and download derby source code in 
this directory. This directory will be referred to as the 
${derby.source} directory in the rest of this document. 

After downloading source code to directory ${derby.source},
there should be the following files and directories:

${derby.source}/build.xml 
${debry.source}/java 
${derby.source}/tools 



2.2   Download required software

This section lists all the required software for Derby
build environment.

Notes:
----- 
(1) Derby build environment requires you to install two levels of 
    Java Development Kit (JDK) - 1.3.x and 1.4.x as Derby is designed 
    to work in JDK1.3.x (JDBC 2.0) and JDK 1.4.x (JDBC 3.0) 
    environments. The Derby build is set up such that that most of 
    the code is compiled against JDK 1.3.x libraries so that no 
    dependencies on JDK 1.4.x classes exist, except for the code 
    that only runs in JDK1.4.x. In addition Derby's JDBC 2.0 
    implementation must compile against JDBC 2.0 class definitions 
    and the JDBC 3.0 implementation against JDBC 3.0 class 
    definitions.

(2) The Derby build environment is tested with JDK 131 (Sun), 
    JDK 141(Sun), and Ant 161. The Derby build environment should
    work with other versions and other sources of JDK 13 (1.3.x) 
    and JDK 14 (1.4.x), and other versions of Ant 1.6 (1.6.x).



2.2.1 Download and install Apache Ant 1.6.x

(1) Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.6.x from:
         http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

(2) Install Ant 1.6.x in any directory. This 
    directory will be referred to as ${ant.dir} 
    directory in the rest of this document. 



2.2.2 Download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) release 1.4.x

Skip steps 1-2 of this section if you already have JDK 1.4.x 
installed on your system.  

(1) Download JDK 1.4.x. 
    The reference implementation is available at:
       http://java.sun.com/j2se

    For MacOS X, get the latest download from:
       http://developer.apple.com/java/download

(2) Install JDK 1.4.x according to the instructions included 
    with the release in any directory. 

(3) The directory where you have installed JDK 1.4.x will be 
    referred to as ${jdk14.dir} in the rest of this document.



2.2.3 Download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) release 1.3.x

Skip steps 1-2 of this section if you already have JDK 1.3.x 
installed on your system or if you are on MacOS X.  

(1) Download JDK 1.3.x. 
    The reference implementation is available at:
       http://java.sun.com/j2se

(2) Install JDK 1.3.x according to the instructions included 
    with the release in any directory. 

(3) The directory where you have installed JDK 1.3.x will be 
    referred to as ${jdk13.dir} in the rest of this document.



2.2.4 Download extensions for Java Development Kit release 1.3.x

(1) JDBC 2.0

    Download JDBC 2.0 (jdbc2_0-stdext.jar) from:
      http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/download.html
    by selecting "JDBC 2.0 Optional Package Binary".

    Save jdbc2_0-stdext.jar file in directory
      ${derby.source}/tools/java 


(2) Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) version 1.2.2

    Download JCE 1.2.2 (jce-1_2_2.zip) from:
      http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index-122.html

    Note: You will need to register to download JCE 1.2.2.

    The downloaded file (jce-1_2_2.zip)  for JCE contains 
    documentation files and multiple jar files. After 
    downloading the zip file, unzip the file and copy only 
    jce1.2.2/lib/jce1_2_2.jar file to directory 
      ${derby.source}/tools/java



2.2.5 Download OSGi Service Platform release 3 (osgi.jar) (Optional)

This is an optional section.
The reason is that osgi.jar is required to only build the 
class org.apache.derby.osgi.EmbeddedActivator. This class 
and jar file manifest entries created in derby.jar allow 
that jar file to be an OSGi bundle. If osgi.jar is not 
present EmbeddedActivator will not be build and derby.jar 
will not contain the manifest entries to be an OSGi bundle.

OSGi Service Platform release 3 (osgi.jar) can be downloaded from: 
   http://osgi.org

Note: You will need to register to download OSGi Service Platform 
      release 3.

The downloaded file should be copied to directory
   ${derby.source}/tools/java 



Note: After following the steps in sections 2.2.4-2.2.8 of this
document, you should have the following:

${derby.source}/tools/java/empty.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/javacc.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/jce1_2_2.jar 
${derby.source}/tools/java/jdbc2_0-stdext.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/geronimo-spec-jta-1.0.1B-rc4.zip 
${derby.source}/tools/java/geronimo-spec-servlet-2.4-rc4.jar
${derby.source}/tools/java/osgi.jar



2.2.6 Download and Install Jikes 1.14 (Optional)

This is an optional section.

Jikes is an open source java compiler that improves compile 
speed over standard java compiler. If you would like to have 
improved compile speed, you can proceed to install Jikes. 
Jikes 1.14 is the required version for derby builds.

Jikes 1.14 can be downloaded from:
    http://jikes.sourceforge.net/
     
Install Jikes 1.14 in any directory. This directory will be 
referred to as the ${jikes.dir} directory in the rest of this 
document. 



---------------------------------------------------------------
3     Build instructions


3.1   Set Required Environmental Variables

(1) Create environment variable ANT_HOME  to point to the 
    directory where you have installed Ant. For example:

     setenv ANT_HOME ${ant.dir} -- On unix(csh)
     export ANT_HOME=${ant.dir} -- On unix(ksh)
     set ANT_HOME=${ant.dir}    -- On Windows

(2) Modify the PATH environment variable to include the 
    directory ${ant.dir}/bin in its list. This makes the "ant" 
    command line script available, which will be used to 
    actually perform the build. Also, if you opted to install
    jikes in section 2.2.8 of this document, add ${jikes.dir} 
    to the PATH as well. For example:

     setenv PATH ${ant.dir}/bin:${jikes.dir}:$PATH -- On unix(csh)
     export PATH=${ant.dir}/bin:${jikes.dir}:$PATH -- On unix(ksh)
     set PATH=${ant.dir}\bin;${jikes.dir};%PATH%   -- On Windows

(3) Create environment variable JAVA_HOME  to point to the 
    directory where you have installed JDK 1.4.x. For example:

     setenv JAVA_HOME ${jdk14.dir} -- On unix(csh).
     export JAVA_HOME=${jdk14.dir} -- On unix(ksh)
     set JAVA_HOME=${jdk14.dir}    -- On Windows



3.2   Create property file

You will need to create a property file to specify
your environment and some of your options. Do the following
to specify your environment and options:

(1) Find out user home directory on your system. You can find  
    user home directory by doing echo on variable %HOME% 
    on windows and $home or $HOME on unix.

(2) Create a file called "ant.properties" in user home 
    directory and define the following variables in 
    "ant.properties". 

    NOTE TO MAC OS X USERS: See section 5.
 
    NOTE TO CYGWIN USERS: Put this in your *Windows* home directory,
    not your Cygwin home directory.

    NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: *use forward slashes* ("/") in your
    path specifications.  Backward-slashes ("\") confuse Ant.
    Check your path specifications for correct use of slashes in 
    ant.properties if you get errors during the build saying java.lang 
    can not be found.

    For example, you should have:

      j13lib=c:/jdk1.3.1_15/lib

    NOT
 
      j13lib=c:\jdk1.3.1_15\lib

   
    - j14lib

      This is a required variable which defines the location of
      JDK 1.4.x. Define the variable as following:

          j14lib=${jdk14.dir}/jre/lib
      
      where ${jdk14.dir} is the directory name where you have 
      installed JDK 1.4.x. Check out section 2.2.2 of this document. 

    - j13lib

      This is a required variable which defines the location of
      JDK 1.4.x. Define the variable as following:

          j13lib=${jdk13.dir}/jre/lib

      where ${jdk13.dir} is the directory name where you have 
      installed JDK 1.3.x. Check out section 2.2.3 of this document.
      
    - build.compiler

      This variable defines if standard java compiler or jikes is 
      used for build. The default value of this variable is set to 
      use standard java compiler for build. If you opted to install
      jikes in section 2.2.8 of this document, you can give your 
      option to use jikes for build by overwriting default value of 
      this variable by setting it as following: 
   
          build.compiler=jikes

    - proceed

      This variable directs Ant to proceed past any build errors and  
      complete rest of the build (when set to true) or stop build any 
      time an error is found (when set to false). The default value 
      for this variable is false. You can overwrite default value 
      by setting it to true by defining the variable as following: 

           proceed=true

    - sane

      By default this variable is set to true and builds
      extra asserts and debugging information in the class
      files. When set to false no extra asserts or debugging 
      information is included in the class files, making Derby
      run faster as it generates smaller class files.
      You can overwrite default value by setting it to false by
      defining the variable as following: 

          sane=false

      Typically applications embedding Derby would use jar files 
      built with sane=false.

3.3   Run Derby build

(1) Go to directory ${derby.source}.

(2) Run the following command to start build:
     
    >ant

    The above command will build all classes into
    ${derby.source}/classes. If you add this directory
    in your classpath, you will have full functionality
    of engine, tools, and network server. 

    In addition, if you would like to build the Derby test
    framework and related files, run the following command:

    >ant testing

(3) Run the following command to build all jars:
    
    >ant buildjars

    The above command will build the following jar files:
    - derby.jar (database engine), 
    - derbytools.jar (utilities: sysinfo, dblook, ij) 
    - derbynet.jar (network server).
    - derbyLocale_*.jar (9 jar files with locale support).
    If the tests were built, the following jar file will also be built:
    - derbyTesting.jar (the test framework and related files)

    You can run the ant command to build an individual jar
    file as following:
    - command "ant derbyjar" to build derby.jar
    - command "ant derbytoolsjar" to build derbytools.jar
    - command "ant derbynetjar" to build derbynet.jar
    - command "ant derbylocalejars" to build the derby locale jar files.
    - command "ant derbytestingjar" to build derbyTesting.jar

Notes: 
(1) The estimated total time for build completion is ~5-10 minutes.

(2) Derby build environment is NOT dependency based build environment.
    Make sure to check out explaination of "clobber" target in
    section 4.1 of this document.



3.4   Verify Derby build

To verify if the Derby build was successful, do the
following:

(1) Run "ant" command again and nothing should happen. No 
    files should get compiled, copied or generated. 

(2) Check if the following directories were created:
      - ${derby.source}/classes
      - ${derby.source}/jars if you have built the 
        jars in step 3 of section 3.3

(3) Execute the following command:
    
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/classes org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    You can also execute one of the following commands if you 
    have built the jars in step 3 of section 3.3:

    For builds with sane=true
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/sane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/sane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    For builds with sane=false
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/insane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/insane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo

    The above commands should report the system info and output 
    should look like the following:

    ------------------ Java Information ------------------
    Java Version:    1.4.1_07
    Java Vendor:     Sun Microsystems Inc.
    Java home:       C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_07
    Java classpath:  c:\derby\classes
    OS name:         Windows 2000
    OS architecture: x86
    OS version:      5.0
    Java user name:  derbyuser
    Java user home:  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator
    Java user dir:   C:\derby
    --------- Derby Information --------
    [C:\derby\classes] 10.0.2.0 - (1)
    ------------------------------------------------------
    ----------------- Locale Information -----------------
    ------------------------------------------------------


(4) Execute the following command:
    
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/classes org.apache.derby.tools.ij 

    You can also execute one of the following commands if you 
    have built the jars in step 3 of section 3.3:

    For builds with sane=true
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/sane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/sane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.ij 

    For builds with sane=false
    >java -cp ${derby.source}/jars/insane/derby.jar:${derby.source}/jars/insane/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.ij 
                
   
(5) Execute the following statement: 

    connect 'jdbc:derby:test;create=true'; 

    The above statement should create and connect to a 
    database with no errors.


(6) Derby also includes a suite of tests for more comprehensive verification.
    Information on how to run these tests can be found in the source tree,
    in the file ${derby.source}/java/testing/README.htm

---------------------------------------------------------------
4     Derby build miscellaneous information

This section provides miscellaneous information about
Derby builds. 



4.1   Derby build targets

Some of the main targets that can be called as
"ant targetname" are as the  following:

  all: builds the source code, demos, and tests.

  buildsource: to build source code. This is default target.

  demo: builds the simple demos in java/demo

  testing: builds the tests in java/testing. For additional information on
           testing, please see java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/README.htm

  javadoc: to create javadoc for all source code.

  publishedapi: to create javadoc for application api classes.

  buildjars: to create jar files

  clobber: remove all built objects except jars. You should run
           this target if you have source code upgrade or
           you changed the source code and you are getting
           some errors.

  clean: remove output directory (${derby.source}/classes)

  cleanjars: remove jars directory (${derby.source}/jars)

  cleandocs: remove javadoc directory (${derby.source}/javadoc)



4.2   Derby source code upgrade

After upgrading derby source code, do the following before 
building the code as per instructions given in section 3.3:

(1) Go to directory ${derby.source}.

(2) Run the following command to clean up:

    >ant clobber



4.3   Derby Build flow

This section provides the information on Derby build flow.
This section can be skipped unless you are really interested
in learning about Derby build flow.
    
Initially, Ant generates state.properties. This file contains 
a single property, sanity, with a boolean value that determines 
the sanity state of the build. 'Sanity' was a concept introduced 
early in Cloudscape as a way of having assert functionality 
in the code before Java actually supported such functionality 
syntactically. It was a way to keep development 'sane,' 
thus the name. Assertions are contained in an if-block based 
on the static final boolean values SanityState.DEBUG or 
SanityState.ASSERT, which are true in a sane (debug) build, 
and false in an insane (non-debug/optimized) build. 
Therefore, in an insane build, a smart compiler will not 
write the code in the if-block into the classfile, since 
it would never be run. 

The source file containing the static final boolean values of the
sanity state, org.apache.derby.iapi.services.sanity.SanityState 
is then generated from a template. The sanity state defaults to 
true. This also directs the compiler to turn on all debugging 
options on the compiler. The sanity state can be set to insane 
by running 'ant insane' or passing in the value -Dsane=false or 
-Dsanity=false. Note that this file will be removed after 
'ant clobber,' so if you are rebuilding from scratch and want 
the build to be a non-debug build, run 'ant insane' before 
building.

Once the sanity state has been generated, Ant prints out for 
reference the current properties that affect the build, 
including base directory, output directory, compiler, 
sanity state, and the value of the java property 'proceed.' 
 
Next, the parser files are generated with JavaCC. Once the parser 
files have been generated, the compilation of the source files 
begins. The source is compiled in a specific order, that order 
being: reference, internal API, public API, implementation. 
At the end of the build, the properties files containing the 
message files are copied into the output directory and the 
version information properties files are generated.


---------------------------------------------------------------
5   Mac OS X Requirements

With Mac OS X, Java is now distributed as core technology, so no 
downloads are needed except to upgrade to the latest release. The
distribution includes both JDK 1.4 and JDK 1.3. Beginning with
Mac OS X 10.4, JDK 1.5 may also be included as a supplemental
download. However, only the JDK 1.4 and JDK 1.3 Java runtime
libraries are needed to compile or run Derby.



5.1   Mac OS X ant.properties

For MacOS X, ant.properties is different from other environments,
and should contain the following. Note that for readability, multiple
jar files are shown as part of the classpath values, but they need
to be entered on a single line in the properties file.

j13lib=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Classes
j14lib=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/Classes
javatools.dir=${basedir}/tools/java

java13compile.classpath=
${j13lib}/classes.jar:
${j13lib}/ui.jar:
${j13lib}/i18n.jar:
${j13lib}/sunrsasign.jar:
${javatools.dir}/jdbc2_0-stdext.jar

java14compile.classpath=
${j14lib}/classes.jar:
${j14lib}/ui.jar:
${j14lib}/laf.jar:
${j14lib}/sunrsasign.jar:
${j14lib}/jsse.jar:
${j14lib}/jce.jar:
${j14lib}/charsets.jar

compile.classpath=${java14compile.classpath}



5.2   Handling of RandomAccessFiles in Mac OS X 10.3

MacOS X 10.3 with JDK 1.4.2 has a bug in the handling of RandomAccessFiles
that causes problems with Derby. This bug causes an exception to be thrown
when reopening a file using specific RandomAccessFile modes for write sync
behavior, preventing Derby from creating or modifying a database on 
Mac OS X 10.3 without the use of the following workaround. This bug has 
been fixed in Mac OS X 10.4.

For full details, please see DERBY-1 in JIRA:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1

The workaround is to provide a derby.properties file with the entry:

derby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog=true

The derby.properties file should be located in your derby.system.home 
directory. For more information, see:
 
http://incubator.apache.org/derby/manuals/tuning/perf14.html#HDRSII-SETPROP-16827

While this bug has been fixed in Mac OS X 10.4, please be aware that
Derby applications that may be deployed on Mac OS X 10.3 will need the
workaround described above to create or modify a Derby database.
