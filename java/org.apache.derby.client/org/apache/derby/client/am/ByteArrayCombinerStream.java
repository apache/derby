/**
 * A stream whose source is a list of byte arrays.
 *
 * This class was created when first implementing the JDBC 4 length less
 * overloads in the client driver. The reason was missing support for
 * streaming data with unknown length from the client to the server.
 *
 * The purpose of the stream is to avoid having to repeatedly copy data to grow
 * the byte buffer, or doing a single big copy to combine the byte arrays in
 * the end. This is important for the temporary solution, since we must
 * materialize the stream to find the length anyway.
 *
 * If there is less data available than the specified length, an exception is
 * thrown. Available data is determined by the length of the byte arrays, not
 * the contents of them. A byte array with all 0's is considered valid data.
 *
 * Besides from truncation, this stream does not change the underlying data in
 * any way.
