/**
 * An object that tracks the state of large objects (LOBs) for the current row
 * in a result set.
 * <p>
 * A LOB's state is either unpublished or published. When a LOB is published, it
 * means that the end-user has been given a reference to the LOB object. This
 * implies that the LOB cannot be automatically freed/released when the
 * result set position changes (i.e. typically {@code rs.next()}), because the
 * LOB object must be kept valid/alive until the transaction is ended or the
 * LOB object is explicitly freed.
 * <p>
 * This class covers two types of functionality regarding LOBs;
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Keep track of whether a LOB column has been published or not.</li>
 *      <li>Release LOB locators on the server.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both functionalities will be disabled if the server doesn't support locators.
 * If locators are enabled, they will be freed when {@link #checkCurrentRow} is
 * called.
 * <p>
 * The tracker has a notion of current row. The current row is changed by
 * calling {@link #checkCurrentRow checkCurrentRow}. The owner of the tracker
 * is repsonsible for invoking the method at the correct time, and only when
 * the cursor is positioned on a valid data row. The method must be invoked
 * before the cursor changes the position. Note that calling the method
 * {@link #discardState discardState} makes {@code checkCurrentRow} ignore all
 * LOBs on the subsequent call.
