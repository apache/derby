 * <LI> To act as the internal documentation for the attributes.
 * <LI> To remove the need to declare a java static field for the attributes
 * name in the protocol/implementation class. This reduces the footprint as the
 * string is final and thus can be included simply as a String constant pool
 * entry.
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * This class should not be shipped with the product.
