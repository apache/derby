/**
 * AssertFailure is raised when an ASSERT check fails. Because assertions are
 * not used in production code, are never expected to fail, and recovering from
 * their failure is expected to be hard, they are under RuntimeException so that
 * no one needs to list them in their throws clauses. An AssertFailure at the
 * outermost system level will result in system shutdown.
 *
 * An AssertFailure also contains a string representation of a full thread dump
 * for all the live threads at the moment it was thrown if the JVM supports it
 * and we have the right permissions.
 *
 * If the JVM doesn't have the method Thread.getAllStackTraces i.e, we are on a
 * JVM &lt; 1.5, or if we don't have the permissions java.lang.RuntimePermission
 * "getStackTrace" and "modifyThreadGroup", a message saying so is stored
 * instead.
 *
 * The thread dump string is printed to System.err after the normal stack trace
 * when the error is thrown, and it is also directly available by getThreadDump().
