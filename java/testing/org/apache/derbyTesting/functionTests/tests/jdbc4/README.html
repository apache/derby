<h1>Running the JDBC4 Tests</h1>

<p>
Currently, there is one suite of tests used to verify JDBC4 features:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>jdbc40</b> - These tests can run with either the embedded or
network client, that is, under either the <i>embedded</i> or
<i>DerbyNetClient</i> frameworks. In general, JDBC4 tests do not run
the JCC client (<i>DerbyNet</i> framework) because that old client
does not support the new JDBC4 feature set.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that two of the tests in this suite
(<i>jdbc4/TestDbMetaData.java</i> and
<i>jdbc4/TestJDBC40Exception.java</i>) are excluded from the
<i>DerbyNetClient</i> run. Eventually, we hope to run these tests
under <i>DerbyNetClient</i>. At that time, we can remove these tests
from <i>suites/DerbyNetClient.exclude</i>.
</p>

<p>
Before running these tests, you must first build the optional jkd16
support as described in <i>trunk/BUILDING.txt</i>.
</p>

<p>
Verifying the JDBC4 feature set is a little tiresome right now. You must
run the following commands in a shell window whose JAVA_HOME points at
your jdk1.6 installation. After each suite run, check the test results.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
java org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite jdbc40

# make sure the above test run succeeded

java -Dframework=DerbyNetClient org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite jdbc40

# make sure the above test run succeeded
</pre></blockquote>
