#
# This properties file is for the repeat test.
# its configuration's only difference from the default configuration
# is that it runs with the statement cache.
#
# This file is expected to be placed into $WS/systest/out by
# the run script, and expects to be run in an environment where
# the property derby.system.home points to $WS/systest/out.
#
# this test tests caching:
derby.language.statementCacheSize=1000
derby.debug.true=StatementCacheInfo
derby.infolog.append=true
