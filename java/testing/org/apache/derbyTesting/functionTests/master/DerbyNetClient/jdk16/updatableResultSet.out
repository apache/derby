Positive Test5 - donot have to select primary key to get an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to delete row when primary key is not selected for that row
Positive Test6a - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownDeletesAreVisible and deletesAreDetected
This is because, after deleteRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row. We don't make a hole for the deleted row and then stay on that deleted hole
ownDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
deletesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowDeleted only if deletesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for detlesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowDeleted() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Positive Test6b - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownUpdatesAreVisible and updatesAreDetected

updatesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowUpdated only if updatesAreDetected returns true

Positive Test8a - change the name of the statement when the resultset is open and see if deleteRow still works
This test works in embedded mode since Derby can handle the change in the name of the statement with an open resultset
But it fails under Network Server mode because JCC and Derby Net Client do not allow statement name change when there an open resultset against it
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid operation: setCursorName() called when there are open ResultSet's on the Statement.

Positive Test9a - using correlation name for the table in the select sql works in embedded mode and Network Server using Derby Net Client driver
Correlation name for table does not work in Network Server mode (using JCC) because the drivers construct the delete sql with the correlation name rather than the base table name
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to deleteRow
PASS!!! passed in embedded mode
Positive Test9b - using correlation name for updatable columns is not allowed.

Positive Test24a - after updateXXX, try cancelRowUpdates and then deleteRow
column 1 on this row before updateInt is 1
column 1 on this row after updateInt is 234
now cancelRowUpdates on the row
Since after cancelRowUpdates(), ResultSet is positioned on the same row, getXXX will pass
column 1 on this row after cancelRowUpdates is 1
Since after cancelRowUpdates(), ResultSet is positioned on the same row, a deleteRow at this point will pass
PASS : deleteRow passed as expected
calling updateRow after deleteRow w/o first positioning the ResultSet on the next row will fail
SQL State : XJ121
Got expected exception Invalid operation at current cursor position.
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should be able to updateRow() on the current row now
