Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Now attempting to send a deleteRow on a read only resultset with FOR UPDATE clause in the SELECT sql.
SQL State : null
Got expected exception This method cannot be invoked while the cursor is on the insert row or if the concurrency of this ResultSet object is CONCUR_READ_ONLY.
Now attempting to send a updateRow on a read only resultset with FOR UPDATE clause in the SELECT sql.

Negative Test5 - request updatable resultset for sql with no FOR UPDATE clause
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Jira issue Derby-159 : Warnings raised by Derby are not getting passed to the Client in Network Server Mode
Will see the warnings in embedded mode only
Now attempting to send a delete on a sql with no FOR UPDATE clause.
SQL State : null
Got expected exception This method cannot be invoked while the cursor is on the insert row or if the concurrency of this ResultSet object is CONCUR_READ_ONLY.

Negative Test7 - attempt to deleteRow & updateRow on updatable resultset when the resultset is not positioned on a row
Make sure that we got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
Now attempt a deleteRow without first doing next on the resultset.
SQL State : XCL08
Got expected exception Cursor 'SQL_CURSH200C7' is not on a row.
Now attempt a updateRow without first doing next on the resultset.
In embedded mode, updateRow will check if it is on a row or not even though no changes have been made to the row using updateXXX
In Network Server mode, if no updateXXX were issued before updateRow, then updateRow is a no-op and doesn't check if it is on a row or not
PASS!!! In Network Server mode, this updateRow is a no-op because no updateXXX were issued before the updateRow
ResultSet is positioned after the last row. attempt to deleteRow at this point should fail!
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid operation: result set closed
ResultSet is positioned after the last row. attempt to updateRow at this point should fail!
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid operation: result set closed
Negative Test8 - attempt deleteRow & updateRow on updatable resultset after closing the resultset
Make sure that we got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid operation: result set closed
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid operation: result set closed
Negative Test9 - try updatable resultset on system table
SQL State : 42Y90
Got expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
Negative Test10 - try updatable resultset on a view
SQL State : 42Y90
Got expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
Negative Test11 - attempt to open updatable resultset when there is join in the select query should fail
SQL State : 42Y90
Got expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
Negative Test12 - With autocommit on, attempt to drop a table when there is an open updatable resultset on it
Opened an updatable resultset. Now trying to drop that table through another Statement
SQL State : X0X95
Got expected exception Operation 'DROP TABLE' cannot be performed on object 'T1' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
Since autocommit is on, the drop table exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
SQL State : 42X01
Got expected exception Syntax error: Encountered "(" at line 1, column 19.
SQL State : 24000
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Negative Test13 - foreign key constraint failure will cause deleteRow to fail
SQL State : 23503
Got expected exception DELETE on table 'TABLEWITHPRIMARYKEY' caused a violation of foreign key constraint 'FK' for key (1,1).  The statement has been rolled back.
Since autocommit is on, the constraint exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
Jira entry Derby-160 : for Network Server because next should have failed
FAIL!!! next should have failed because foreign key constraint failure resulted in a runtime rollback
Negative Test14 - foreign key constraint failure will cause updateRow to fail
SQL State : 42X01
Got expected exception Syntax error: Encountered "(" at line 1, column 36.
Since autocommit is on, the constraint exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
Jira entry Derby-160 : for Network Server because next should have failed
FAIL!!! next should have failed because foreign key constraint failure resulted in a runtime rollback
Negative Test15 - Can't call updateXXX methods on columns that do not correspond to a column in the table
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Column not updatable
Negative Test16 - Call updateXXX method on out of the range column
There are only 2 columns in the select list and we are trying to send updateXXX on column position 3
SQL State : null
Got expected exception Invalid argument: parameter index 3 is out of range.
Positive Test1a - request updatable resultset for forward only type resultset
requested TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, CONCUR_UPDATABLE
got TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY? true
got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
JDBC 2.0 updatable resultset apis on this ResultSet object will pass because this is an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row before deleteRow is 1
column 2 on this row before deleteRow is aa                  
Since after deleteRow(), in embedded mode, ResultSet is positioned before the next row, getXXX will fail
In Network Server mode, the ResultSet stays on the deleted row after deleteRow and hence no error for getXXX
column 1 on this deleted row is 0
calling deleteRow again w/o first positioning the ResultSet on the next row will fail
SQL State : 24000
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should be able to deletRow() on the current row now
Finished testing updateable resultsets
