--FOREIGN KEY "<name>" is not valid because the table cannot be defined as a dependent of

--Explanation: A referential constraint cannot be defined because the object table of the CREATE TABLE or 
--ALTER TABLE statement cannot be defined as a dependent of table "<table-name>" for one of the following reason codes: 
--(01) The relationship is self-referencing and a self-referencing relationship already exists
-- with the SET NULL delete rule. 
--(02) The relationship forms a cycle of two or more tables that cause the table to be delete-connected 
--to itself (all other delete rules in the cycle would be CASCADE). 
--(03) The relationship causes the table to be delete-connected to the indicated table through 
--multiple relationships and the delete rule of the existing relationship is SET NULL. 
--The delete rules of the existing relationships cause an error, not the delete rule specified in 
--the FOREIGN KEY clause of the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement.
