Test - most columns allowed in a table
First create a table with one column less than maximum allowed number of columns
  Try alter table on it to have table with maximum allowed number of columns
  Try another alter table to have table with one column more than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (1013) were specified for  table or view T1. The limit is 1012.
Next create a table with maximum allowed number of columns
  Try alter table to have table with more columns than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (1013) were specified for  table or view T1. The limit is 1012.
Found 1012 columns/parameters through meta data
Next create a table with one column more than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (1013) were specified for  table or view T1. The limit is 1012.
Finally, create a table with 2 columns more than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (1014) were specified for  table or view T1. The limit is 1012.
Test - most columns allowed in a view
First create a view with one column less than maximum allowed number of columns
Next create a view with maximum allowed number of columns
Found 5000 columns/parameters through meta data
Next create a view with one column more than that maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (5001) were specified for  table or view V1. The limit is 5000.
And finally create a view with 2 columns that maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception Too many columns (5002) were specified for  table or view V1. The limit is 5000.
Test - most elements allowed in a select list
First try a select with one column less than maximum allowed number of columns
Next try a select with maximum allowed number of columns
Next try a select with one column more than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception SELECT statement has too many items in GROUP BY, ORDER BY or select list.
Next try a select with 2 more columns than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception SELECT statement has too many items in GROUP BY, ORDER BY or select list.
Test - most columns allowed in a ORDER BY clause
First try order by with one column less than maximum allowed number of columns
Next try an order by with maximum allowed number of columns
Next try an order by with one column more than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception SELECT statement has too many items in GROUP BY, ORDER BY or select list.
And finally try an order by with 2 more columns than maximum allowed number of columns
expected exception SELECT statement has too many items in GROUP BY, ORDER BY or select list.
Test - most parameters allowed for a stored procedure
First create a procedure with one parameter less than maximum allowed number of parameters
Next create a procedure with maximum allowed number of parameters
Found 90 columns/parameters through meta data
And finally create a procedure with more parameters that maximum allowed number of parameters
expected exception The limit for the number of parameters for a procedure has been exceeded. Limit is 90 and number of parameters for procedure P3 are 91.
