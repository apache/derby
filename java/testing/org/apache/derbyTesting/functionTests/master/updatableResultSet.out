Positive Test5 - donot have to select primary key to get an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to delete row when primary key is not selected for that row
Positive Test6a - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownDeletesAreVisible and deletesAreDetected
This is because, after deleteRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row. We don't make a hole for the deleted row and then stay on that deleted hole
ownDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
deletesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowDeleted only if deletesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for detlesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowDeleted() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Positive Test6b - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownUpdatesAreVisible and updatesAreDetected
This is because, after updateRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row
ownUpdatesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersUpdatesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
updatesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowUpdated only if updatesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for updatesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowUpdated() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowUpdated() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Have this call to rs.rowUpdated() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Positive Test7a - delete using updatable resultset api from a temporary table
following rows in temp table before deleteRow
	 C21,C22

Positive Test8a - change the name of the statement when the resultset is open and see if deleteRow still works
This test works in embedded mode since Derby can handle the change in the name of the statement with an open resultset
But it fails under Network Server mode because JCC and Derby Net Client do not allow statement name change when there an open resultset against it
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
PASS!!! passed in embedded mode
Positive Test8b - change the name of the statement when the resultset is open and see if updateRow still works
This test works in embedded mode since Derby can handle the change in the name of the statement with an open resultset
But it fails under Network Server mode because JCC and Derby Net Client do not allow statement name change when there an open resultset against it
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to updateRow
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to updateRow
PASS!!! passed in embedded mode
Positive Test9a - using correlation name for the table in the select sql works in embedded mode and Network Server using Derby Net Client driver
Correlation name for table does not work in Network Server mode (using JCC) because the drivers construct the delete sql with the correlation name rather than the base table name
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to deleteRow
PASS!!! passed in embedded mode
Positive Test9b - using correlation name for updatable columns is not allowed.
Table t1 has following rows
	 C1,C2

Positive Test10 - 2 updatable resultsets going against the same table, will they conflict?
delete using first resultset
attempt to send deleteRow on the same row through a different resultset should throw an exception
