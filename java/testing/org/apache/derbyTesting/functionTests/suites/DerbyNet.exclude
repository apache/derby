# excluding resultsetStream.java because this test uses java.io.FileInputStream throughout the test
# excluding TestErrorStreamTarget.java since it's not relevant for clients
# excluding scrollCursors2.java because updatable resultsets & scroll sensitive cursors are not supported
# excluding batchUpdate.java for it hits a problem in networkserver ('beetle' 5561)
# excluding statementJdbc20.java because this tests fetch_reverse throughout the test
# excluding jdbcapi/testRelative.java because this is a new test contributed by Shreyas Kaushik and needs to be debugged with JCC  in order to get it running with network server
# excluding jdbcapi/SetQueryTimeoutTest.java because neither the JCC driver nor the ClientDriver support setQueryTimeout() yet.
# excluding lang/updatableResultSet.java because changes are required in JCC Driver for this test to run correctly
# excluding jdbcapi/rsgetXXXcolumnNames.java as it fails incorrectly, according to JDBC spec. Forwarding test case to JCC team.
# excluding jdbcapi/resultsetJdbc30.java because the features tested are not implemented by JCC driver or ClientDriver
# excluding jdbcapi/checkDataSource30.java - Client behaves differently. Need to look into this
# excluding jdbcapi/statementJdbc30.java - Client behaves differently. Need to look into this
# excluding jdbcapi/holdCursorJava.java - JCC behaves differently with hold cursors.
# excluding jdbcapi/dataSourceReference.java - client side only tests, tests all data sources
#           regardless of framework
# excluding largedata/LobLimits.java to run with the network server because currently lobs are materialized and this test tests for 2G lobs.
