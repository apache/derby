# this file holds tests that cannot be successfully run with DerbyNetClient framework
# with a remote server. Tests in this file will be skipped in addition to those in 
# DerbyNetClient.exclude when the property -DhostName is set to something else than the localhost
#
# excluding test   - because...
#     a database cannot be loaded by 2 different instances.
# derbynet/dblook_test_net because it tries to search derby.log, which is on
#     the server machine
# derbynet/dblook_test_net_territory because it tries to search derby.log, which is on
#     the server machine
# started with specific property set - DERBY928 for reference 
# thus not suitable for remote server testing in its current form. - DERBY-928
# lang/wisconsin - optimization is quite different when running remote server.
