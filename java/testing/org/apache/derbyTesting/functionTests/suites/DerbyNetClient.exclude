# excluding TestErrorStreamTarget.java since it's not relevant for clients
# excluding scrollCursors2.java because updatable resultsets & scroll sensitive cursors are not supported
# excluding batchUpdate.java for it hits a problem in networkserver ('beetle' 5561)
# excluding statementJdbc20.java because this tests fetch_reverse throughout the test
# excluding jdbcapi/statementJdbc30.java - Client behaves differently. Need to look into this
# excluding jdbcapi/dataSourceReference.java - client side only tests, tests all data sources
#           regardless of framework
# excluding largedata/LobLimits.java to run with the network server because currently lobs are materialized and this test tests for 2G lobs.

# Currently, we exclude jdbc4/TestDbMetaData.java and
# jdbc4/TestJDBC40Exception.java from the jdbc40 suite.
# Eventually, we hope they will run under the network client.
