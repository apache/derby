# excluding TestErrorStreamTarget.java since it's not relevant for clients
# excluding statementJdbc20.java because this tests fetch_reverse throughout the test
# excluding jdbcapi/statementJdbc30.java - Client behaves differently. Need to look into this
# excluding jdbcapi/dataSourceReference.java - client side only tests, tests all data sources
#           regardless of framework
# excluding largedata/LobLimits.java to run with the network server because currently lobs are materialized and this test tests for 2G lobs.
