/**

    A quick and dirty class for generating a properties file from the maint
    property in DBMS.properties and release.properties. Useful for getting
    the values of the third and fourth parts of the version number into Ant
    as separate properties. It puts the third value into the output properties
    as the property "interim", and the fourth value as "point".

    Usage: java maintversion2props input_properties_file output_properties_file
