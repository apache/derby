/**
	<P><B>Services</B><BR>

	A service is a collection of modules that combine to provide
	the full functionality defined by the service. A service is defined
	by three pieces of information:
	<OL>
	<LI>A fully qualified java class name that identifies the functionality or API
	that the service must provide. Typically this class represents a java interface.
	This class name is termed the <EM>factory interface</EM>.
	<LI>The <EM>identifier</EM> of the service. Services are identified by a String, this may
	be hard-coded, come from a UUID or any other source.
	<LI>An optional java.util.Properties set.
	</OL>
	<BR>
	The running functionality of the service is provided by a module
	that implements the factory interface. The identifier of the this module
	is not (need not be) the same as the identifier of the service. The identifier
	of the service is held by the monitor in its service tables.
	<BR>
	Each module in a service is keyed by at least one factory interface, identifier}
	pair. This pair is guaranteed to be unique within the service.
	<BR>
	The lifetime of a module in a service is no longer than the lifetime of the service.
	Thus shutting down a service shuts down all the modules within a service.
	<B>Optionally - </B> an individual module within a service may be shutdown, this will
	in turn shutdown any modules it started if those module are not in use by other
	modules within the service. This would be handled by the monitor, not the module itself.
	<BR>
	A service may be persistent, it goes through a boot in create mode, and subsequently boot
	in non-create mode, or a non-peristent service, it always boots in non-create mode.
	Persistent services can store their re-start parameters in their properties set, the monitor
	provides the persistent storage of the properties set.
	Non-persistent services do not have a properties set.

	<P><B>Booting Services</B><BR>
	Services can be booted a number of ways
	<UL>
	<LI>A non-persistent service can be booted by having a property in the application properties
	or the system (JVM) set.
	<PRE>
	derby.service.<EM>service name</EM>=<EM>class name</EM>
	e.g.
	# Added to the properties automatically by the class org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
	derby.service.jdbc=java.sql.Driver
	</PRE>
	<LI>A persistent service can be booted by having a property in the application properties
	or the system (JVM) set.
	<PRE>
	derby.service.<EM>service name</EM>=<EM>persistent storage type</EM>
	e.g.
	derby.service.mydatabase=serviceDirectory
	</PRE>
	serviceDirectory is a type understood by the monitor which means that there is a directory
	named mydatabase within the system directory and within it is a properties file service.properties. This properties
	set is the set for the service and must contain a property
	<PRE>
	derby.protocol=<EM>class name</EM>
	</PRE>
	This is then the factory interface for the service. Other storage types could be added in
	the future.
	<LI>
	The monitor at start time looks for all persistent services that it can find and starts them.
	E.g. all directories in the system directory that have a file service.properties are started
	as services.
	<LI>Services are started on demand, e.g. a findService attempts to boot a service if it
	cannot be found.
	</UL>
	<B>Any or all of these three latter methods can be implemented. A first release may
	just implement the look for all services and boot them.</B>
	.
	<P><B>System Service</B><BR>
	A special service exists, the System Service. This service has no factory interface,
	no identifier and no Properties set. It allows modules to be started that are required
	by another service (or the monitor itself) but are not fundamentally part of the service.
	Modules within this service are unidentified.
	Typically these modules are system wide types of functionality like streams, uuid creation etc.
	<BR>
	The lifetime of a system module is the lifetime of the monitor.
	<B>Optionally - </B> this could be changed to reference count on individual modules, requires
	some minor api changes.

	<P><B>Modules</B><BR>

	A module is found or booted using four pieces of information:
	<OL>
	<LI>The service the module lives in or will live in.
	<LI>A fully qualified java class name that identifies the functionality or API
	that the module must provide. Typically this class represents a java interface.
	This class name is termed the <EM>factory interface</EM>.
	<LI>The <EM>identifier</EM> of the module. Modules are identified by a String, this may
	be null, be hard-coded, come from a UUID or any other source. If the identifier
	is null then the module is described as <EM>unidentified</EM>.
	<LI>Boot time only - A java.util.Properties set. This Properties set is service wide
	and typically contains parameters used to determine module implementation or runtime
	behaviour.
	</OL>
	<BR>
	The service is identified by explicitly identifiying the System Service or
	by providing a reference to a module that already exists with the required service.
	<BR>
	The factory interface is provided by a String constant of the form class.MODULE
	from the required interface.
	<BR>
	The module identifier is provided in a fashion determined by the code, in most
	cases a unidentified module will suffice.
	<BR>
	The Properties set is also determined in a fashion determined by the code at
	create or add service time.

  <P><B>Module Implementations</B><BR>

	When creating an instance of a module, an implementation is found through lists of
	potential implementations.
	<BR>
	A list of potential implementations is obtained from a Properties set. Any property
	within this set that is of the form
	<PRE>
	derby.module.<EM>tag</EM>=<EM>java class name</EM>
	</PRE>
	is seen by the monitor as a possible implementation. <EM>tag</EM> has no meaning within
	the monitor, it is only there to provide uniqueness within the properties file. Typically
	the tag is to provide some description for human readers of the properties file, e.g.
	derby.module.lockManager for an implementation of a lock manager.
	<BR>
	The monitor looks through four properties sets for lists of potential implementations in this
	order. 
	<OL>
	<LI>The properties set of the service (i.e. that passed into Monitor.createPersistentService()
	or Monitor.startService()).
	<LI>The System (JVM) properties set (i.e. java.lang.System.getProperties()).
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2400
	<LI>The application properties set (i.e. obtained from the derby.properties file).
	<LI>The default implementation properties set (i.e. obtained from the
	/org/apache/derby/modules.properties resource).
	</OL>
	Any one of the properties can be missing or not have any implementations listed within it.
	<BR>
	Every request to create an instance of a module searches the four implementation
	lists in the order above. Which list the current running code or the passed in service
	module came from is not relevant.
	<BR>
	Within each list of potential implementations the search is conducted as follows:
	<OL>
	<LI>Attempt to load the class, if the class cannot be loaded skip to the next potential
	implementation.
	<LI>See if the factory interface is assignable from the class (isAssignableFrom() method
	of java.lang.Class), if not skip to the next potential implementation.
	<LI>See if an instance of the class can be created without any exceptions (newInstance() method
	of java.lang.Class), if not skip to the next potential implementation.
	<LI>[boot time only] See if the canSupport() method of ModuleControl returns true when called with the
	Properties set of the service, if not skip to the next potential implementation.
	</OL>
	If all these checks pass then the instance is a valid implementation and its boot() method
	of ModuleControl is called to activate it. Note that the search order within
	the list obtained from a Properties set is not guaranteed.

	 <P><B>Module Searching</B><BR>

	When searching for a module the search space is always restricted to a single service.
	This service is usually the system service or the service of the module making the
	search request. It would be very rare (wrong?) to search for a module in a service that
	was not the current service and not the system service.
	<BR>
	Within the list of modules in the service the search is conducted as follows:
	<OL>
	<LI>See if the instance of the module an instance of the factory interface (isInstance() method
	of java.lang.Class), if not skip to the next module.
	<LI>See if the identifier of the module matches the required identifier, if not skip to the next module.
	<LI>See if the canSupport() method of ModuleControl returns true when called with the
	Properties set of the service, if not skip to the next module.
	</OL>
	Note that no search order of the modules is guaranteed.
	<BR>
	Also note that a module may be found by a different factory interface to the one
	it was created under. Thus a class may implement multiple factory interfaces, its boot
	method has no knowledge of which factory interface it was requested by.

  <P><B>Service Properties</B><BR>

	Within the service's Properties a module may search for its parameters. It identifies
	its parameters using a unqiue parameter name and its identifier.
	<BR>
	Unique parameter names are made unique through the 'dot' convention of Properties
	files. A module protocol picks some unique key portion to start, e.g. RawStore for the RawStoreFactory
	and then extends that for specific parameters, e.g. RawStore.PageSize. Thus
	parameters that are typically understood by all implementations of that protocol would
	start with that key portion. Parameters for specific implementations add another key portion
	onto the protocol key portion, e.g. RawStore.FileSystem for an file system implementation
	of the raw store, with a specific parameter being RawStore.FileSystem.SectorSize.

	<BR>These are general guidelines, UUID's could be used as the properties keys but
	would make the parameters hard to read.
	<BR>
	When a module is unidentified it should look for a parameter using just
	the property key for that parameter, e.g. getProperty("RawStore.PageSize").
	<BR>
	When a module has an identifier is should look for a property using the
	key with a dot and the identifier appended, e.g. getProperty("RawStore.PageSize" + "." + identifier).
	<BR>
	In addition to searching for parameters in the service properties set, the system and
	application set may be searched using the getProperty() method of ModuleFactory.
	<BR><B>Should any order be defined for this, should it be automatic?</B>
