/**
	Any object that needs to be locked must implement Lockable.
	This allows a generic lock manager that can have locking policies
	defined on a per-object basis.

    A request to lock the object takes a qualifier, this qualifier may be
	used the object to implement a complex locking policy, e.g. traditional
	database shared, update and exclusive locks. 
	<P>
	The lock manager uses this ordered protocol to determine if a lock request on a
	Lockable <TT> L </TT> with qualifier <TT> Q1 </TT> in compatibility space
	<TT> CS1 </TT> can be granted:
	<OL>
	<LI>If no locks are held on <TT> L </TT> in any compatability space then the
	request is granted.
	<LI>If <TT>L.requestCompatible(Q1)</TT> returns true then the lock is granted.
	<LI>Otherwise the request is granted if the following expression evaluates
	to true for every other lock <TT>{ CSn, Qn}</TT> held on <TT> L </TT>
	<UL>
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
	<LI> <PRE>    ( ( CSn == CS1 ) &amp;&amp; L.lockerAlwaysCompatible() ) </PRE>
	<LI> <PRE> || (L.reqestCompatible(Q1, Qn)) </PRE>
	</UL>
	</OL>
	<BR>
	If the request is granted then a call is made to <TT> L.lockEvent(CS1, Q1) </TT>.
	<BR>
	When the lock is released a call is made to <TT> L.unlockEvent(CS1, Q1) </TT>.
    <P>
	The lock manager uses equals() and hashCode() to identify unique Lockables.
	<BR>
	If the class implementing Lockable requires that each instance of class
	correspond to a different locked object then the equals() method must test
	equality via the reference equality test (==), this is the default behaviour
	for equality.
	<BR>
	If the class implementing Lockable require that each instance of the class
	that has the same value (as defined by the class) corresponds to a locked
	object then its equals() method must reflect that, e.g. by testing equality
	of its fields. In this case the first Lockable to be locked will be kept
	by lock manager as the key for the lock. Thus even after the first caller
	unlocks the object, its reference will still be kept by the lock manager.
	Thus Lockable's that per value equality must be designed so that they
	are never re-used for different lockable concepts.
	<BR>
	In either case the equals() method must accept a reference to an object of
	a different type.
	<BR>
	As per standard hashtable rules the value returned by hashCode() must be in sync
	with the equals() method.

	<BR>
	MT - Mutable - : single thread required, synchronization is provided by the lock manager.
	If the class implementing Lockable uses value equality then it must have an immutable identity.
