/**

The Diagnostic framework is meant to provide a way to include as much
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2400
diagnostic capability within the distributed release of the Derby
product without adversely affecting the runtime speed or foot print of
a running configuration that needs not use this information.

In order to decrease the class size of running objects diagnostic information
should be put in "helper" classes.  So to provide diagnostic capabiility
on the implementation of class Foo.java create a class D_Foo.java.  Class
D_Foo must implement the Diagnosticable interface.  

This class provide utility functions to get at the information provided by
the D_* helper class:
    findDiagnostic() - given and object "obj", get an instance of D_obj. 
    toDiagString()   - return the "best" diagnostic string available about
                       a given object.
