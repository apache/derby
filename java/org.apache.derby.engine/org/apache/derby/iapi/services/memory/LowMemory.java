/**
 * Methods to aid classes recover from OutOfMemoryErrors by denying
 * or reducing service rather than a complete shutdown of the JVM.
 * It's intended that classes use to functionality to allow then to
 * deny service when memory is low to allow the JVM to recover,
 * rather than start new operations that are probably doomed to
 * failure due to the low memory.
 * <P>
 * Expected usage is one instance of this class per major logical
 * operation, e.g. creating a connection, preparing a statement,
 * adding an entry to a specific cache etc.
 * <BR>
 * The logical operation would call isLowMemory() before starting
 * the operation, and thrown a static exception if it returns true.
 * <BR>
 * If during the operation an OutOfMemoryException is thrown the
 * operation would call setLowMemory() and throw its static exception
 * representing low memory.
 * <P>
 * Future enhancments could be a callback mechanism for modules
 * where they register they can reduce memory usage on a low
 * memory situation. These callbacks would be triggered by
 * a call to setLowMemory. For example the page cache could
 * reduce its current size by 10% in a low memory situation.
