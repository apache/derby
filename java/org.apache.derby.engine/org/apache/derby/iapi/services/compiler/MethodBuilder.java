/**
	MethodBuilder is used to generate the code for a method.
	<P>

	The code for a method is built in a way that corresponds to the
	layout of the stack machine that is the Java Virtual Machine.
	Values are pushed on the stack, moved about on the stack
	and then popped off the stack by operations such as method
	calls. An understanding of hoe the JVM operates is useful
	before using this class.

	<P>
	All the method descriptions below are generating bytecode
	to achieved the desired behaviour when the generated class
	is loaded. None of this class's methods calls actually
	invoke methods or create objects described by the callers.
