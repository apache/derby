/**
 * ClassBuilder is used to construct a java class's byte array
 * representation.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   No checking for language use violations such as invalid modifiers
 *	or duplicate field names.
 *   All classes must have a superclass; java.lang.Object must be
 *      supplied if there is no superclass.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a class is first created, it has:
 * <ul>
 * <li> a superclass
 * <li> modifiers
 * <li> a name
 * <li> a package
 * <li> no superinterfaces, methods, fields, or constructors
 * <li> an empty static initializer
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * MethodBuilder implementations are required to get code out of the
 * constructs within their bodies in some manner. 
 * Most typically, they may have a stream to which the statement and 
 * expression constructs write the code that they represent,
 * and they walk over the statements and expressions in the appropriate order.
 *
