 * based one--all XML data is stored on disk as a UTF-8 string,
 * just like the other Derby string types.  In order to make
 * it possible for smarter XML implementations to exist in
 * the future, this class always writes an "XML implementation
 * id" to disk before writing the rest of its data.  When
 * reading the data, the impl id is read first and serves
 * as an indicator of how the rest of the data should be
 * read.
 *
 * So long as there's only one implementation (UTF-8)
 * the impl id can be ignored; but when smarter implementations
 * are written, the impl id will be the key to figuring out
 * how an XML value should be read, written, and processed.
