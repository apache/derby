/**
 * The ResultSet interface provides a method to tell whether a statement
 * returns rows, and if so, a method to get the rows. It also provides a
 * method to get metadata about the contents of the rows. It also provide
 * a method to accept rows as input.
 * <p>
 * There is no single implementation of the ResultSet interface. Instead,
 * the various support operations involved in executing statements
 * implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * Although ExecRow is used on the interface, it is not available to
 * users of the API. They should use Row, the exposed super-interface
 * of ExecRow.  [I couldn't find another way to perform this mapping...]
