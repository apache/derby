     * Insert all rows that qualify for the current scan into the input
     * Hash table.  
     * <p>
     * This routine scans executes the entire scan as described in the 
     * openScan call.  For every qualifying unique row value an entry is
     * placed into the HashTable. For unique row values the entry in the
     * Hashtable has a key value of the object stored in 
     * row[key_column_number], and the value of the data is row.  For row 
     * values with duplicates, the key value is also row[key_column_number], 
     * but the value of the data is a Vector of
     * rows.  The caller will have to call "instanceof" on the data value
     * object if duplicates are expected, to determine if the data value
     * of the Hashtable entry is a row or is a Vector of rows.
     * <p>
     * Note, that for this routine to work efficiently the caller must 
     * ensure that the object in row[key_column_number] implements 
     * the hashCode and equals method as appropriate for it's datatype.
     * <p>
     * It is expected that this call will be the first and only call made in
     * an openscan.  Qualifiers and stop position of the openscan are applied
     * just as in a normal scan.  This call is logically equivalent to the 
     * caller performing the following:
     *
     * import java.util.Hashtable;
     *
     * hash_table = new Hashtable();
     *
     * while (next())
     * {
     *     row = create_new_row();
     *     fetch(row);
     *     if ((duplicate_value = 
     *         hash_table.put(row[key_column_number], row)) != null)
     *     {
     *         Vector row_vec;
     *
     *         // inserted a duplicate
     *         if ((duplicate_value instanceof vector))
     *         {
     *             row_vec = (Vector) duplicate_value;
     *         }
     *         else
     *         {
     *             // allocate vector to hold duplicates
     *             row_vec = new Vector(2);
     *
     *             // insert original row into vector
     *             row_vec.addElement(duplicate_value);
     *
     *             // put the vector as the data rather than the row
     *             hash_table.put(row[key_column_number], row_vec);
     *         }
     *         
     *         // insert new row into vector
     *         row_vec.addElement(row);
     *     }
     * }
     * <p>
     * The columns of the row will be the standard columns returned as
     * part of a scan, as described by the validColumns - see openScan for
     * description.
     * RESOLVE - is this ok?  or should I hard code somehow the row to
     *           be the first column and the row location?
     * <p>
     * No overflow to external storage is provided, so calling this routine
     * on a 1 gigabyte conglomerate will incur at least 1 gigabyte of memory
     * (probably failing with a java out of memory condition).  If this
     * routine gets an out of memory condition, or if "max_rowcnt" is 
     * exceeded then then the routine will give up, empty the Hashtable, 
     * and return "false."
     * <p>
     * On exit from this routine, whether the fetchSet() succeeded or not
     * the scan is complete, it is positioned just the same as if the scan
     * had been drained by calling "next()" until it returns false (ie. 
     * fetchNext() and next() calls will return false).  
     * reopenScan() can be called to restart the scan.
     * <p>
     *
     * RESOLVE - until we get row counts what should we do for sizing the
     *           the size, capasity, and load factor of the hash table.
     *           For now it is up to the caller to create the Hashtable,
     *           Access does not reset any parameters.
     * <p>
     * RESOLVE - I am not sure if access should be in charge of allocating
     *           the new row objects.  I know that I can do this in the
     *           case of btree's, but I don't think I can do this in heaps.
     *           Maybe this is solved by work to be done on the sort 
     *           interface.
     *
     *
     * @param max_rowcnt        The maximum number of rows to insert into the 
     *                          Hash table.  Pass in -1 if there is no maximum.
     * @param key_column_numbers The column numbers of the columns in the
     *                          scan result row to be the key to the Hashtable.
     *                          "0" is the first column in the scan result
     *                          row (which may be different than the first
     *                          row in the table of the scan).
