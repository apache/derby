  A scan is the mechanism for iterating over the rows in a conglomerate,
  the scan controller is the interface through which access clients
  control the underlying scan.  An instance of a scan controller can 
  be thought of as an open scan.
  <p>
  Scans are opened from a TransactionController.
  <P>
  A ScanController can handle partial rows. Partial rows
  are described in RowUtil.
  <BR>
  A scan controller is opened with a FormatableBitSet that describes the
  columns that need to be returned on a fetch call. This FormatableBitSet
  need not include any columns referenced in the qualifers, start
  and/or stop keys.
