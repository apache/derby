/** 

  The Orderable interface represents a value that can
  be linearly ordered.
  <P>
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
  Currently only supports linear (&lt;, =, &lt;=) operations.
  Eventually we may want to do other types of orderings,
  in which case there would probably be a number of interfaces
  for each "class" of ordering.
  <P>
  The implementation must handle the comparison of null
  values.  This may require some changes to the interface,
  since (at least in some contexts) comparing a value with
  null should return unknown instead of true or false.
