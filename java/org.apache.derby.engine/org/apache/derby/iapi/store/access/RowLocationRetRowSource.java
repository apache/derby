	/**
		rowLocation is a callback for the drainer of the row source to return
		the rowLocation of the current row, i.e, the row that is being returned
		by getNextRowFromRowSource.  This interface is for the purpose of
		loading a base table with index.  In that case, the indices can be
		built at the same time the base table is laid down once the row
		location of the base row is known.  This is an example pseudo code on
		how this call is expected to be used:
		
		<BR><pre>
		boolean needsRL = rowSource.needsRowLocation();
		DataValueDescriptor[] row;
		while((row = rowSource.getNextRowFromRowSource()) != null)
		{
			RowLocation rl = heapConglomerate.insertRow(row);
			if (needsRL)
				rowSource.rowLocation(rl);
		}
		</pre><BR>

		NeedsRowLocation and rowLocation will ONLY be called by a drainer of
		the row source which CAN return a row location.  Drainer of row source
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-532
        which cannot return rowLocation will guarantee to not call either
		callbacks. Conversely, if NeedsRowLocation is called and it returns
		true, then for every row return by getNextRowFromRowSource, a
		rowLocation callback must also be issued with the row location of the
		row.  Implementor of both the source and the drain of the row source
		must be aware of this protocol.

		<BR>
		The RowLocation object is own by the caller of rowLocation, in other
		words, the drainer of the RowSource.  This is so that we don't need to
		new a row location for every row.  If the Row Source wants to keep the
		row location, it needs to clone it (RowLocation is a ClonableObject).
