     * <p>
     * Often, after a scan, the client of RawStore has a much better estimate
     * of the number of rows in the container than what store has. Currently,
     * a scan, followed by an update of the estimate, will be performed when:
     * <ul>
     *      <li>running SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_UPDATE_STATISTICS</li>
     *      <li>the automatic update of index statistics kicks in
     *          (see {@code IndexStatisticsDaemon})</li>
     *      <li>performing table scans</li>
     *      <li>creating an index on a populated table</li>
     * </ul>
     * This interface allows the client to set the estimated row count for the
     * container, and store will use that number for all future references.
     * <p>
     * This routine can also be used to set the estimated row count in the
     * index to the number of rows in the base table, another workaround for
     * the problem that index estimated row count includes non-user rows.
     *
     * @param count the estimated number of rows in the container.
