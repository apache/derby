/**

A conglomerate is an abstract storage structure (they
correspond to access methods).  The Conglomerate interface
corresponds to a single instance of a conglomerate. In
other words, for each conglomerate in the system, there
will be one object implementing Conglomerate.
<P>
The Conglomerate interface is implemented by each access method.
The implementation must maintain enough information to properly
open the conglomerate and scans, and to drop the conglomerate.
This information typically will include the id of the container
or containers in which the conglomerate is stored, and my also
include property information.
<P>
Conglomerates are created by a conglomerate factory.  The access
manager stores them in a directory (which is why they implement
Storable).
