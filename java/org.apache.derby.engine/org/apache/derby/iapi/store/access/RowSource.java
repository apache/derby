  A RowSource is the mechanism for iterating over a set of rows.  The RowSource
  is the interface through which access recieved a set of rows from the client
  for the purpose of inserting into a single conglomerate.

  A RowSource can come from many sources - from rows that are from fast path
  import, to rows coming out of a sort for index creation.

		<BR>
		A return of null indicates that the complete set of rows has been read.

		<p>
		A null column can be specified by leaving the object null, or indicated
		by returning a non-null getValidColumns.  On streaming columns, it can
		be indicated by returning a non-null get FieldStates.
