  <p>
  A structure which is used to "qualify" a column.  Specifies
  that the column value in a given column identified by column
  id is to be compared via a specific operator to a particular
  DataValueDescriptor value.
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </p>
  <p>
  The implementation of this interface is provided by the client; 
  the methods of Qualifier are the methods the access code uses to use it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Arrays of qualifiers are provided to restrict the rows 
  returned by scans.  A row is returned from a scan if all qualifications
  in the array return true.  
  </p>
  <p>
  A qualification returns true if in the following pseudo-code compare_result
  is true.
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
  if (qualifier.negateCompareResult())
  {
      compare_result = 
      row[(qualifier.getColumnId())].compare(
        qualifier.getOperator(), 
        qualifier.getOrderable(),
        qualifier.getOrderedNulls(), 
        qualifier.getUnknownRV()) 
      if (qualifier.negateCompareResult())
      {
          compare_result = !(compare_result);
      }
  }
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </pre></blockquote>
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1665
  <p>
  Qualifiers are often passed through interfaces as a set of Qualifiers,
  rather than one at a time, for example see the qualifier argument in 
  TransactionController.openScan(). 
  </p>
  <p>
  To make this consistent the following protocols are to be used when passing
  around sets of Qualifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
  A single dimensional array is to be used to pass around a set of AND'd 
  qualifiers.  Thus qualifier[] argument is to be treated as:
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
      qualifier[0] AND qualifer[1] ... AND qualifier[qualifer.length - 1]
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  A two dimensional array is to be used to pass around a AND's and OR's in
  conjunctive normal form.  The top slot of the 2 dimensional array is optimized
  for the more frequent where no OR's are present.  The first array slot is 
  always a list of AND's to be treated as described above for single dimensional
  AND qualifier arrays.  The subsequent slots are to be treated as AND'd arrays
  of OR's.  Thus the 2 dimensional array qual[][] argument is to be treated as 
  the following, note if qual.length = 1 then only the first array is valid and
  it is and an array of AND clauses:
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </p>
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1665
  <blockquote><pre>
  (qual[0][0] AND qual[0][0] ... AND qual[0][qual[0].length - 1])
  AND
  (qual[1][0] OR  qual[1][1] ... OR  qual[1][qual[1].length - 1])
  AND
  (qual[2][0] OR  qual[2][1] ... OR  qual[2][qual[2].length - 1])
  ...
  AND (qual[qual.length - 1][0] OR  qual[1][1] ... OR  qual[1][2])
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  If any of the array's qual[0].length ... qual[qual.length -1] are 0 length
  they will be evaluated as TRUE; but they must be not NULL.  See Example 4 for
  encoding of (a or b) that takes advantage of this.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that any of the arrays qual[0].length ... qual[qual.length -1] may also
  be of length 1, thus no guarantee is made the presence of OR
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
  predicates if qual.length &lt; 1. See example 1a.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following give pseudo-code examples of building Qualifier arrays:
  </p>
  <p>
  Example 1: "a AND b AND c"
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
    qualifier = new Qualifier[1][3]; // 3 AND clauses

    qualifier[0][0] = a
    qualifier[0][1] = b
    qualifier[0][2] = c
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  Example 1a "a AND b AND c" - less efficient than example 1 but legal
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
    qualifier = new Qualifier[3]; // 3 AND clauses
    qualifier[0] = new Qualifier[1];
    qualifier[1] = new Qualifier[1];
    qualifier[2] = new Qualifier[1];
	
    qualifier[0][0] = a
    qualifier[1][0] = b
    qualifier[2][0] = c
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  Example 2: "(f) AND (a OR b) AND (c OR d OR e)"
    Would be represented by an array that looks like the following:
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
    qualifier = new Qualifier[3]; // 3 and clauses
    qualifier[0] = new Qualifier[1]; // to be intitialized to f
    qualifier[1] = new Qualifier[2]; // to be initialized to (a OR b)
    qualifier[2] = new Qualifier[3]; // to be initialized to (c OR d OR e)

    qualifier[0][0] = f
    qualifier[1][0] = a
    qualifier[1][1] = b
    qualifier[2][0] = c
    qualifier[2][1] = d
    qualifier[2][2] = e
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  Example 3: "(a OR b) AND (c OR d) AND (e OR f)" 
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
    qualifier = new Qualifier[3]; // 3 and clauses
    qualifier = new Qualifier[4]; // 4 and clauses
    qualifier[0] = new Qualifier[1]; // to be intitialized to TRUE
    qualifier[1] = new Qualifier[2]; // to be initialized to (a OR b)
    qualifier[2] = new Qualifier[2]; // to be initialized to (c OR d)
    qualifier[3] = new Qualifier[2]; // to be initialized to (e OR f)

    qualifier[0][0] = TRUE
    qualifier[1][0] = a
    qualifier[1][1] = b
    qualifier[2][0] = c
    qualifier[2][1] = d
    qualifier[3][0] = e
    qualifier[3][1] = f
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6945
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  Example 4: "(a OR b)" 
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>
    qualifier = new Qualifier[2]; // 2 and clauses
    qualifier[0] = new Qualifier[0]; // 0 length array is TRUE
    qualifier[1] = new Qualifier[2]; // to be initialized to (a OR b)

    qualifier[1][0] = a
    qualifier[1][1] = b
  </pre></blockquote>
