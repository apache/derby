/**
 * <p> 
 * This is the interface for the replication master controller
 * service. The master controller service is booted when this instance
 * of Derby will have the replication master role for this database.
 * </p> 
 * <p> 
 * The replication master service is responsible for managing all
 * replication related functionality on the master side of replication.
 * This includes connecting to the slave, setting up a log buffer to
 * temporarily store log records from the LogFactory, and to ship
 * these log records to the slave.
 * </p> 
 * <p> 
 * The master controller currently only supports asynchronous
 * replication. This means that there are no guarantees that
 * transactions that have committed here (the master side) are also
 * reflected on the slave side. However, the slave version of the
 * database IS guaranteed to be transaction consistent. This implies
 * that: <br>
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>A transaction t that is committed on the master will either be
 *  fully reflected or not be reflected at all on the slave when the
 *  slave database is turned into a non-replicated database (that is,
 *  at failover time)</li>
 *
 *  <li>Slave execution of operations is in the same serial order as
 *  on the master because replication is based on redoing log records
 *  to the slave. By definition, log records are in serial order. This
 *  implies that if transaction t1 commits before t2 on the master,
 *  and t2 has been committed on the slave, t1 is also guaranteed to
 *  have committed on the slave.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
