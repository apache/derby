/**
	RawTransaction is the form of Transaction used within the raw store. This
	allows the break down of RawStore functionality into (at least) three modules
	(Transactions, Data, Log) without exposing internal information on the
	external interface.

	<P>
	The transaction will notify any Observer's just before the transaction
	is committed, aborted or a rollback to savepoint occurs. The argument passed
	to the update() method of the Observer's will be one of
	<UL>
	<LI> RawTransaction.COMMIT - transaction is committing
	<LI> RawTransaction.ABORT - transaction is aborting
	<LI> RawTransaction.SAVEPOINTROLLBACK - transaction is being rolled back to a savepoint
	</UL>
	The observer's must perform a value equality check (equals()) on the 
    update arg to see why it is being notified.
