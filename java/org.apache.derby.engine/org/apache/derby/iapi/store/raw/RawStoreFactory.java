/**
    RawStoreFactory implements a single unit of transactional
    storage. A RawStoreFactory contains Segments and Segments
    contain Containers.
    <P>
    Segments are identified
    by integer identifiers that are unique within a RawStoreFactory.
    <P>
    Containers are also identified by unique integer identifiers
    within a RawStoreFactory, but will overlap with segment identifiers.
    <P><B>LIMITS</B><BR>
    This is a list of (hopefully) all limits within the raw store. Where a size 
    has more than one limit all are documented (rather than just the most 
    restrictive) so that the correct limit can be found if the most restictive 
    is every removed.

    <P>
    Access and RawStore work together to provide the ACID properties of
    transactions. On a high level, RawStore deals with anything that directly
    impacts persistency. On a more detailed level, RawStore provides
    logging, rollback and recovery, data management on page, page allocation
    and deallocation, container allocation and deallocation.  


    <P>
    RawStore is organized as 3 branches, transaction, data, and
    logging.  These branches each have its own "factory", the transaction
    factory hands out transactions, the data factory hands out containers,
    and the log factory hands out logger (or log buffers) for transactions to
    write on.  For a more detailed description on these factories, please see
    their corresponding javadocs.

        the page cache.  Internally this is referred to as the "ContainerCache".
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3734

        Each object in this cache maps to a java level "open" file on a file
        in the database directory.  Although actual implementation depends on
        JVM implementation, this usually maps to underlying open file resources
        in the underlying operating system.  Setting this number too high
        may result in I/O failures reported by Derby, which are the result 
        of hitting some user and/or OS limit on the number of open files
        allowed.  These I/O errors may happen during read, write and/or open 
        operations.  
        Sometimes these limits can be avoided simply by executing an OS 
        specific command to raise the maximum open files allowed by whatever
        mechanism is used to control resources allowed to be consumed by
        the JVM.

        Derby may also open other files separate from this cache, so exausting
        the open file resource may cause other operations than I/O to data
        pages to fail.  A partial list of these operations includes: 
        recovery logging, error logging, external sorting, and 
        LOB disk overflow.

        The default maximum size of this cache is 100 open files.
        The minimum size of this cache is 2 open files, attempting to set this
        cache to a smaller size or a negative number will result in a size 2
        cache.  Setting the cache size to a number bigger than an INT, or any
        sort of illegal format number will result in a cache size of 100
        open files.
