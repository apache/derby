/**
A OverflowInputStream is used by store to turn a long column into an 
InputStream.
<p>
Any time store fetches a long column, the value is returned as a stream.
A long column is any column that at some point was longer than a page, so
a long column in one table may not be long in another depending on page size.
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
<p>
When the column is fetched a new OverflowInputStream is created and then
the datatype's stream is set using:
 ((StreamStorable)sColumn).setStream(OverflowInputStream);
