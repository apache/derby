/**
 * <p>
 * Scan a chunk of log received from the master. The log chunk (byte[]
 * logToScan) is assumed to always contain (an unknown) number of
 * complete log records. If the last log record is incomplete,
 * something is wrong. This will raise a StandardException, and will
 * probably mean that replication has to be aborted. That decision is
 * not made here, though.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a new chunk of log records is to be scanned, ReplicationLogScan
 * is initialized by calling init(...). Every time next() is called
 * after that, ReplicationLogScan reads a new log record from
 * logToScan. If next() returns true, the next log record was
 * successfully read. The information in this last read log record
 * either indicates that a log file switch has taken place on the
 * master (isLogSwitch() = true) or it is a normal log record which
 * information can be retrieved by using the get-methods (if
 * isLogRecord() = true).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Threads: The class does not provide thread synchronization since it
 * is assumed that only one thread will be receiving and applying log
 * per replicated database when in slave mode. Since a
 * ReplicationLogScan object belongs to only one slave database, this
 * means that only one thread will access the object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The format of the log chunk byte[] is defined in 
 * org.apache.derby.impl.store.raw.log.LogAccessFile
 * </p>
