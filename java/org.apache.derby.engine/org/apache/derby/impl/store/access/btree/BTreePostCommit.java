/**

The BTreePostCommit class implements the Serviceable protocol.  

In it's role as a Serviceable object, it stores the state necessary to 
find a page in a btree that may have committed delete's to reclaim.

In it's role as a PostCommitProcessor it looks up the page described, and
reclaims space in the btree.  It first trys to clean up any deleted commits
on the page.  It then will shrink the tree if it is going to delete all
rows from the page (RESOLVE - not done yet).
