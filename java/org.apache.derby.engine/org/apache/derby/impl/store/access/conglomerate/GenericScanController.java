/**
Generic class implementing shared ScanController methods.

Logically a scancontroller is used to scan a set of rows that meet some 
specified qualification.  Rows that meet the qualification may be operated
upon by the scan to fetch, delete, or replace.  The ScanController also
supports the notion or "repositioning" the scan, which simply resets the
beginning of the scan to a new place, and allows the user to continue from
there.

This class attempts to abstract out some of the parts of the scan such that
maybe multiple access methods can share code, even if they perform parts of
the scan wildly differently.  Here is how the scan has been broken apart:

scan_position - this variable holds the current scan position, it may be 
                extended
                to provide more information if necessary.

//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2462
scan_state    - a scan has 5 possible states:
                SCAN_INIT, SCAN_INPROGRESS, SCAN_DONE, SCAN_HOLD_INIT, and
                SCAN_HOLD_INPROGRESS

positionAtInitScan()
              - This routine is called to move the scan to the SCAN_INIT state.
                It is used both for initialization of the ScanController and
                by reopenScan().

positionAtStartForForwardScan()
              - This routine is called to move the scan from SCAN_INIT to 
                SCAN_INPROGRESS.  Upon return from this routine it is expected
                that scan_position is set such that calling the generic 
                scan loop will reach the first row of the scan.  Note that this
                usually means setting the scan_postion to one before the 1st 
                row to be returned.

fetchRows()   - This routine is the meat of the scan, it moves the scan to the
                next row, applies necessary qualifiers, and handles group or
                non-group operations.  It moves through rows on a page in
                order and then moves to the "next" page.

positionAtNextPage()
              - This routine handles moving the scan from the current 
                scan_position to the next page.

positionAtDoneScan()
              - Handle all cleanup associated with moving the scan state from
                SCAN_INPROGRESS to SCAN_DONE.  This may include releasing locks,
                and setting the state of the scan.  This does not close the 
                scan, it allows for a reopenScan() to be called.

    /*
     * There are 5 states a scan can be in.
     *     SCAN_INIT - A scan has started but no positioning has been done.
     *                 The scan will be positioned when the first next() call
     *                 has been made.  None of the positioning state variables
     *                 are valid in this state.
     *     SCAN_INPROGRESS -
     *                 A scan is in this state after the first next() call.
     *                 On exit from any GenericScanController method, while in 
     *                 this state,
     *                 the scan "points" at a row which qualifies for the 
     *                 scan.  While not maintaining latches on a page the 
     *                 current position of the scan is either kept by record
     *                 handle or key.  To tell which use the following:
     *                 if (record key == null)
     *                    record handle has current position
     *                 else
     *                    record key has current position
     *
     *     SCAN_DONE - Once the end of the table or the stop condition is met
     *                 then the scan is placed in this state.  Only valid 
     *                 ScanController method at this point is close().
     *
     *     SCAN_HOLD_INIT -
     *                 The scan has been opened and held open across a commit,
     *                 at the last commit the state was SCAN_INIT.
     *                 The scan has never progressed from the SCAN_INIT state
     *                 during a transaction.  When a next is done the state
     *                 will either progress to SCAN_INPROGRESS or SCAN_DONE.
     *
     *     SCAN_HOLD_INPROGRESS -
     *                 The scan has been opened and held open across a commit,
     *                 at the last commit the state was in SCAN_INPROGRESS.
     *                 The transaction which opened the scan has committed,
     *                 but the scan was opened with the "hold" option true.
     *                 At commit the locks were released and the "current"
     *                 position is remembered.  In this state only two calls
     *                 are valid, either next() or close().  When next() is
     *                 called the scan is reopened, the underlying container
     *                 is opened thus associating all new locks with the current
     *                 transaction, and the scan continues at the "next" row.
