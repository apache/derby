    Fetch the row at the next position of the Scan.

    If there is a valid next position in the scan then
	the value in the template storable row is replaced
	with the value of the row at the current scan
	position.  The columns of the template row must
	be of the same type as the actual columns in the
	underlying conglomerate.

    The resulting contents of templateRow after a fetchNext() 
    which returns false is undefined.

    The result of calling fetchNext(row) is exactly logically
    equivalent to making a next() call followed by a fetch(row)
    call.  This interface allows implementations to optimize 
    the 2 calls if possible.

    RESOLVE (mikem - 2/24/98) - come back to this and see if 
    coding this differently saves in sort scans, as did the
    heap recoding.

    @param row The template row into which the value
	of the next position in the scan is to be stored.

    @return True if there is a next position in the scan,
	false if there isn't.
