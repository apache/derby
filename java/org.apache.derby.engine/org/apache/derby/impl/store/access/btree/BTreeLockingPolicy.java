/**

The generic.BTree directory wants to know as little about locking as possible,
in order to make the code usuable by multiple implementations.  But the 
generic code will make calls to abstract lock calls implemented by concrete
btree implementations.  Concrete implementations like B2I understand locking,
and needs informatation specific to the implementation to make the lock calls.
<p>
This class is created and owned by the concrete application, but is passed
into and returned from the generic code when lock calls are made.
Concrete implementations which do not need lock calls can just pass a null
pointer where a BTreeLockingPolicy is requested.
<p>
There are 2 types of lock interfaces, lockScan*() and lockNonScan*().
<p>
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4177
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2991
The lockScan*() interfaces save the key for the current scan position before
giving up the latch on the page if they have to wait for a row lock. The
callers can reposition the scan using the saved key by calling
{@code BTreeScan.reposition()} if such a situation occurs. Then the latches
are reobtained, possibly on a different page if the current key has been moved
to another page in the meantime. Upon return from these interfaces
the row lock requested is guaranteed to have been obtained on the correct
key for the row requested.  These interfaces handle the special case of 
unique indexes where the RowLocation can change while waiting on the lock 
(see implementation for details), basically the lock is retryed after waiting
if the RowLocation has changed.
<p>
The lockNonScan*() interfaces do not save the current scan position. If these
routines return that the latch was released while waiting to obtain the
lock, then the caller must requeue the lock request after taking appropriate
action.  This action usually involves researching the tree to make sure 
that the correct key is locked with latches held. These interfaces
do not handle the special case of unique indexes where the RowLocation can 
change while waiting on the lock, as the row may disappear when the latch
is released to wait on the lock - thus it is necessary that the caller retry
the lock if the interface returns that the latch was released.
