/**

 * in a branch page at level N, is the child page field pointing the page at 
 * level N-1 which has keys which follow or equal the branch row entry.
 *
 * There are 3 ways to use this class to produce a branch row:
 *   createEmptyTemplate() 
 *      creates a empty row template
 *   createBranchRowFromOldBranchRow() 
 *      creates a new row with reference to an old branch row.
 *   createBranchRowFromOldLeafRow()
 *      creates a new row with reference to an old leaf row.
