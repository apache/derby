/**

A BTreeScan implementation that provides the 95% solution to the max on
btree problem.  If the row is the last row in the btree it works very
efficiently.  This implementation will be removed once backward scan is
fully functional.

The current implementation only exports to the user the ability to call
fetchMax() and get back one row, none of the generic scan ablities are
exported.  

To return the maximum row this implementation does the following:
1) calls positionAtStartPosition() which returns with the a latch on the
   rightmost leaf page and a lock on the rightmost leaf row on that page.
   It will loop until it can get the lock without waiting while holding
   the latch.  At this point the slot position is just right of the
   locked row.
2) in fetchMax() it loops backward on the last leaf page, locking rows
   as it does so, until it finds the first non-deleted, non-NULL row.
3) If it is not successful in this last page search it attempts to latch
   the left sibling page, without waiting to avoid deadlocks with forward
   scans, and continue the search on that page.
4) If the sibling page couldn't be latched without waiting, save the
   current position, release all latches, and restart the scan from the
   saved position.
