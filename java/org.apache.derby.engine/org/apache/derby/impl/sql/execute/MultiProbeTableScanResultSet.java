 * Result set that fetches rows from a scan by "probing" the underlying
 * table with a given list of values.  Repeated calls to getNextRowCore()
 * will first return all rows matching probeValues[0], then all rows matching
 * probeValues[1], and so on (duplicate probe values are ignored).  Once all
 * matching rows for all values in probeValues have been returned, the call
 * to getNextRowCore() will return null, thereby ending the scan. The
 * expectation is that this kind of result set only ever appears beneath
 * some other top-level result set (esp. IndexRowToBaseRowResultSet), in
 * which case all result sets higher up in the result set tree will just
 * see a stream of rows satisfying the list of probe values.
 *
 * Currently this type of result is used for evaluation of IN lists, where
 * the user wants to retrieve all rows for which some target column has a
 * value that equals one of values in the IN list.  In that case the IN list
 * values are represented by the probeValues array.
 *
 * Most of the work for this class is inherited from TableScanResultSet. 
 * This class overrides four public methods and two protected methods
 * from TableScanResultSet.  In all cases the methods here set probing
 * state and then call the corresponding methods on "super".

     *   B - The second is for multi-probing.  Here we want to reopen
     * the scan on this table to look for rows matching the next value

     *
     * If we are reopening the scan for scenario A (join processing)

     * which this scan belongs is a "oneRowRightSide" join, meaning
     * that this, the "right" side scan, will be "interrupted" after

		 *
		 * Note that it *is* possible for a start/stop key to contain more
		 * than one column (ex. if we're scanning a multi-column index). In
		 * that case we plug probeValue into the first column of the start
		 * and/or stop key and leave the rest of the key as it is.  As an
		 * example, assume we have the following predicates:
		 *
		 *    ... where d in (1, 20000) and b > 200 and b <= 500

		 * And assume further that we have an index defined on (d, b).

		 * and TWO stop predicates: the IN list will give us "d = probeVal",
		 * which is a start predicate and a stop predicate; then "b > 200"
		 * may give us a second start predicate, while "b <= 500" may give
		 * us a second stop predicate.  So in this situation we want our
		 * start key to be:
		 *
		 *    (probeValue, 200)
		 *
		 * and our stop key to be:
		 *
		 *    (probeValue, 500).
		 *
		 * This will effectively limit the scan so that it only returns
		 * rows whose "D" column equals probeValue and whose "B" column
		 * falls in the range of 200 thru 500.

		 * Note: Derby currently only allows a single start/stop predicate
