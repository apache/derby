	A pre-compiled activation that supports a single ResultSet with
	a single constant action. All the execution logic is contained
	in the constant action.
    <P>
    At compile time for DDL statements this class will be picked
    as the implementation of Activation. The language PreparedStatement
    will contain the ConstantAction created at compiled time.
    At execute time this class then fetches a language ResultSet using
    ResultSetFactory.getDDLResultSet and executing the ResultSet
    will invoke the execute on the ConstantAction.
