/**
 * This is a wrapper class which invokes the Execution-time logic for
 * Misc statements. The real Execution-time logic lives inside the
 * executeConstantAction() method. Note that when re-using the
 * language result set tree across executions (DERBY-827) it is not
 * possible to store the ConstantAction as a member variable, because
 * a re-prepare of the statement will invalidate the stored
 * ConstantAction. Re-preparing a statement does not create a new
 * Activation unless the GeneratedClass has changed, so the existing
 * result set tree may survive a re-prepare.
