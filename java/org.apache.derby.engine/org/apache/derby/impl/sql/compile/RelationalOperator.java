	 *
	 * Note that this method has two uses: 1) see if this operator (or
	 * more specifically, the predicate to which this operator belongs)
	 * can be used as a join predicate (esp. for a hash join), and 2)

	 * whether or not we're pushing.  In particular, for binary ops
	 * that are join predicates, if we're just trying to find an
	 * equijoin predicate then this op qualifies if it references either
	 * the target table OR any of the base tables in the table's subtree.
	 * But if we're planning to push the predicate down to the target
	 * table, this op only qualifies if it references the target table
	 * directly.  This difference in behavior is required because in
	 * case 1 (searching for join predicates), the operator remains at
	 * its current level in the tree even if its operands reference
	 * nodes further down; in case 2, though, we'll end up pushing
	 * the operator down the tree to child node(s) and that requires
	 * additional logic, such as "scoping" consideration.  Until
	 * that logic is in place, we don't search a subtree if the intent
	 * is to push the predicate to which this operator belongs further
	 * down that subtree.  See BinaryRelationalOperatorNode for an
