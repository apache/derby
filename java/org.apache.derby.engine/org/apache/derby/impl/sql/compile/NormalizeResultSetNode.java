/**
 *
 * A NormalizeResultSetNode represents a normalization result set for any 
 * child result set that needs one.  See non-javadoc comments for 
 * a walk-through of a couple sample code paths.
 */

 /*
 * Below are a couple of sample code paths for NormlizeResultSetNodes.
 * These samples were derived from Army Brown's write-ups attached to DERBY-3310
 * and DERBY-3494.  The text was changed to include the new code path now that 
 * all of the NormalizeResultSetNode  code has been moved into the init() method.
 * There are two sections of code in NormalizeResultSetNode.init() that are relevant:
 * First the code to generate the new node based on the child result set. 
 * We will call this "normalize node creation".
 * 
 *       ResultSetNode rsn  = (ResultSetNode) childResult;
 *       ResultColumnList rcl = rsn.getResultColumns();
 *       ResultColumnList targetRCL = (ResultColumnList) targetResultColumnList;
 *       ...
 *       ResultColumnList prRCList = rcl;
 *       rsn.setResultColumns(rcl.copyListAndObjects());
 *       ...
 *       this.resultColumns = prRCList;
 *
 * Next the code to adjust the types for the NormalizeResultSetNode.  
 * We will call this "type adjustment"
 * 
 *       if (targetResultColumnList != null) {
 *           int size = Math.min(targetRCL.size(), resultColumns.size());
 *           for (int index = 0; index < size; index++) {
 *           ResultColumn sourceRC = (ResultColumn) resultColumns.elementAt(index);
 *           ResultColumn resultColumn = (ResultColumn) targetRCL.elementAt(index);
 *           sourceRC.setType(resultColumn.getTypeServices());
 *           }    
 *           
 * --- Sample 1 : Type conversion from Decimal to BigInt on insert ---  
 * (DERBY-3310 write-up variation) 
 * The SQL statement on which this sample focuses is:
 * 
 * create table d3310 (x bigint);
 * insert into d3310 select distinct * from (values 2.0, 2.1, 2.2) v; 
 * 
 * There are three compilation points of interest for this discussion:
 * 1. Before the "normalize node creation"
 * 2. Before the "type adjustment"
 * 3. After the  "type adjustment"
 * 
 * Upon completion of the "type adjustment", the compilation query 
 * tree is then manipulated during optimization and code generation, the 
 * latter of which ultimately determines how the execution-time ResultSet 
 * tree is going to look.\u00a0 So for this discussion we walk through the query
 * tree as it exists at the various points of interest just described.
 * 
 * 1) To start, the (simplified) query tree that we have looks something like the following:
 * 
 *      InsertNode
 * (RCL_0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
 *           |
 *        SelectNode
 * (RCL_1:ResultColumn_1<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *       FromSubquery
 * (RCL_2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *        UnionNode
 * (RCL_3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)
 * 
 * Notation: In the above tree, node names with "_x" trailing them are used to
 *  distinguish Java Objects from each other. So if ResultColumn_0 shows up 
 *  more than once, then it is the *same* Java object showing up in different 
 *  parts of the query tree.  Type names in angle brackets, such as "<BigInt>",
 *  describe the type of the entity immediately preceding the brackets.  
 *  So a line of the form:
 * 
 *   RCL_0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>
 * 
 * describes a ResultColumnList object containing one ResultColumn object 
 * whose type is BIGINT. We can see from the above tree that, before 
 * normalize node creation, the top of the compile tree contains an 
 * InsertNode, a SelectNode, a FromSubquery, and a UnionNode, all of 
 * which have different ResultColumnList objects and different ResultColumn 
 * objects within those lists.
 * 
 * 2) After the normalize node creation
 * The childresult passed to the init method of NormalizeResultSetNode is 
 * the InsertNode's child, so it ends up creating a new NormalizeResultSetNode 
 * and putting that node on top of the InsertNode's child--that is, on top of 
 * the SelectNode.
 *
 * At this point it's worth noting that a NormalizeResultSetNode operates 
 * based on two ResultColumnLists: a) its own (call it NRSN_RCL), and b) 
 * the ResultColumnList of its child (call it NRSN_CHILD_RCL). More 
 * specifically, during execution a NormalizeResultSet will take a row 
 * whose column types match the types of NRSN_CHILD_RCL, and it will 
 * "normalize" the values from that row so that they agree with the 
 * types of NRSN_RCL. Thus is it possible--and in fact, it should generally 
 * be the case--that the types of the columns in the NormalizeResultSetNode's 
 * own ResultColumnList are *different* from the types of the columns in 
 * its child's ResultColumnList. That should not be the case for most 
 * (any?) other Derby result set.
 * 
 * So we now have:
 *
 *      InsertNode
 * (RCL_0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
 *          |
 *  NormalizeResultSetNode
 * (RCL_1:ResultColumn_1<Decimal> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *        SelectNode
 * (RCL_4:ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *      FromSubquery
 * (RCL_2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *        UnionNode
 * (RCL_3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)
 *
 * Notice how, when we generate the NormalizeResultSetNode, three things happen:
 * 
 * a) The ResultColumList object for the SelectNode is "pulled up" into the 
 * NormalizeResultSetNode.
 * b) SelectNode is given a new ResultColumnList--namely, a clone of its old
 *  ResultColumnList, including clones of the ResultColumn objects.
 * c) VirtualColumnNodes are generated beneath NormalizeResultSetNode's 
 * ResultColumns, and those VCNs point to the *SAME RESULT COLUMN OBJECTS* 
 * that now sit in the SelectNode's new ResultColumnList.  
 * Also note how the generated VirtualColumnNode has no type of its own; 
 * since it is an instance of ValueNode it does have a dataTypeServices 
 * field, but that field was not set when the NormalizeResultSetNode was 
 * created.  Hence "<no_type>" in the above tree.
 * 
 * And finally, note that at this point, NormalizeResultSetNode's 
 * ResultColumnList has the same types as its child's ResultColumnList
 * --so the NormalizeResultSetNode doesn't actually do anything 
 * in its current form.
 * 
 * 3) Within the "type adjustment"
 * 
 * The purpose of the "type adjustment" is to take the types from 
 * the InsertNode's ResultColumnList and "push" them down to the 
 * NormalizeResultSetNode. It is this method which sets NRSN_RCL's types 
 * to match the target (INSERT) table's types--and in doing so, makes them 
 * different from NRSN_CHILD_RCL's types.  Thus this is important because 
 * without it, NormalizeResultSetNode would never change the types of the 
 * values it receives.
 * 
 * That said, after the call to sourceRC.setType(...) we have:
 *
 *      InsertNode
 * (RCL0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
 *           |
 *   NormalizeResultSetNode
 * (RCL1:ResultColumn_1<BigInt> -> VirtualColumnNode_0<no_type> -> ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *        SelectNode
 * (RCL4:ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *       FromSubquery
 * (RCL2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *        UnionNode
 * (RCL3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)
 *
 * The key change here is that ResultColumn_1 now has a type of BigInt 
 * intead of Decimal.  Since the SelectNode's ResultColumn, ResultColumn_4,
 *  still has a type of Decimal, the NormalizeResulSetNode will take as input
 *  a Decimal value (from SelectNode) and will output that value as a BigInt, 
 *  where output means pass the value further up the tree during execution 
 *  (see below).
 * 
 * Note before the fix for DERBY-3310, there was an additional type change 
 * that caused problems with this case.    
 * See the writeup attached to DERBY-3310 for details on why this was a problem.  
 *  
 * 4) After preprocessing and optimization:
 * 
 * After step 3 above, Derby will move on to the optimization phase, which 
 * begins with preprocessing.  During preprocessing the nodes in the tree 
 * may change shape/content to reflect the needs of the optimizer and/or to 
 * perform static optimizations/rewrites. In the case of our INSERT statement 
 * the preprocessing does not change much:
 *
 *     InsertNode
 * (RCL0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
 *          |
 *  NormalizeResultSetNode
 * (RCL1:ResultColumn_1<BigInt> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *       SelectNode
 * (RCL4:ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *   ProjectRestrictNode_0
 * (RCL2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *       UnionNode
 * (RCL3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)
 *
 * The only thing that has changed between this tree and the one shown in 
 * step 3 is that the FromSubquery has been replaced with a ProjectRestrictNode.
 * Note that the ProjectRestrictNode has the same ResultColumnList object as 
 * the FromSubquery, and the same ResultColumn object as well.  That's worth 
 * noting because it's another example of how Java objects can be "moved" 
 * from one node to another during Derby compilation.
 * 
 * 5) After modification of access paths:
 * As the final stage of optimization Derby will go through the modification 
 * of access paths phase, in which the query tree is modified to prepare for 
 * code generation.  When we are done modifying access paths, our tree looks 
 * something like this:

      InsertNode
 (RCL0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
           |
   NormalizeResultSetNode
 (RCL1:ResultColumn_1<BigInt> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
           |
      DistinctNode
 (RCL4:ResultColumn_4<Decimal> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_5<Decimal>)
           |
     ProjectRestrictNode_1
 (RCL5:ResultColumn_5<Decimal>)
           |
    ProjectRestrictNode_0
 (RCL2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
           |
        UnionNode
 (RCL3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)

 * The key thing to note here is that the SelectNode has been replaced with two 
 * new nodes: a ProjectRestrictNode whose ResultColumnList is a clone of the 
 * SelectNode's ResultColumnList, and a DistinctNode, whose ResultColumnList 
 * is the same object as the SelectNode's old ResultColumnList.  More 
 * specifically, all of the following occurred as part of modification of 
 * access paths:
 *  
 * a)    The SelectNode was replaced with ProjectRestrictNode_1, whose 
 * ResultColumnList was the same object as the SelectNode's ResultColumnList.
 *
 * b)    the ResultColumList object for ProjectRestrictNode_1 was pulled up 
 * into a new DistinctNode.
 *
 * c)    ProjectRestrictNode_1 was given a new ResultColumnList--namely, a 
 * clone of its old ResultColumnList, including clones of the ResultColumn 
 * objects.
 * 
 * d)    VirtualColumnNodes were generated beneath the DistinctNode's 
 * ResultColumns, and those VCNs point to the same result column objects 
 * that now sit in ProjectRestrictNode_1's new ResultColumnList.
 * 
 * 6) After code generation:
 *
 * During code generation we will walk the compile-time query tree one final 
 * time and, in doing so, we will generate code to build the execution-time 
 * ResultSet tree. As part of that process the two ProjectRestrictNodes will 
 * be skipped because they are both considered no-ops--i.e. they perform 
 * neither projections nor restrictions, and hence are not needed.  
 * (Note that, when checking to see if a ProjectRestrictNode is a no-op, 
 * column types do *NOT* come into play.)
 *
 * Thus the execution tree that we generate ends up looking something like:
 *
 *     InsertNode
 * (RCL0:ResultColumn_0<BigInt>)
 *           |
 *   NormalizeResultSetNode
 * (RCL1:ResultColumn_1<BigInt> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_4<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *      DistinctNode
 * (RCL4:ResultColumn_4<Decimal> -> VirtualColumnNode<no_type> -> ResultColumn_5<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *     ProjectRestrictNode_1
 * (RCL5:ResultColumn_5<Decimal>)
 *          |
 *   ProjectRestrictNode_0
 * (RCL2:ResultColumn_2<Decimal>)
 *           |
 *       UnionNode
 * (RCL3:ResultColumn_3<Decimal>)
 *
 * At code generation the ProjectRestrictNodes will again be removed and the 
 * execution tree will end up looking like this:
 * 
 *    InsertResultSet
 *      (BigInt)
 *          |
 *  NormalizeResultSet
 *      (BigInt)
 *          |
 *   SortResultSet
 *      (Decimal)
 *          |
 *   UnionResultSet
 *      (Decimal)
 *
 * where SortResultSet is generated to enforce the DistinctNode, 
 * and thus expects the DistinctNode's column type--i.e. Decimal.
 * 
 * When it comes time to execute the INSERT statement, then, the UnionResultSet 
 * will create a row having a column whose type is DECIMAL, i.e. an SQLDecimal 
 * value.  The UnionResultSet will then pass that up to the SortResultSet, 
 * who is *also* expecting an SQLDecimal value.  So the SortResultSet is 
 * satisfied and can sort all of the rows from the UnionResultSet.  
 * Then those rows are passed up the tree to the NormalizeResultSet, 
 * which takes the DECIMAL value from its child (SortResultSet) and normalizes 
 * it to a value having its own type--i.e. to a BIGINT.  The BIGINT is then 
 * passed up to InsertResultSet, which inserts it into the BIGINT column 
 * of the target table.  And so the INSERT statement succeeds.
 * 
 * ---- Sample 2 -  NormalizeResultSetNode and  Union (DERBY-3494 write-up variation)
 * Query for discussion
 * 
 *
 * create table t1 (bi bigint, i int);
 *  insert into t1 values (100, 10), (288, 28), (4820, 2);
 *
 * select * from
 *   (select bi, i from t1 union select i, bi from t1) u(a,b) where a > 28;
 *
 *
 * Some things to notice about this query:
 * a) The UNION is part of a subquery.
 * b) This is *not* a UNION ALL; i.e. we need to eliminate duplicate rows.
 * c) The left side of the UNION and the right side of the UNION have 
 * different (but compatible) types: the left has (BIGINT, INT), while the 
 * right has (INT, BIGINT).
 * d) There is a predicate in the WHERE clause which references a column 
 * from the UNION subquery.
 * e) The table T1 has at least one row.
 * All of these factors plays a role in the handling of the query and are 
 * relevant to this discussion.
 * 
 * Building the NormalizeResultSetNode. 
 * When compiling a query, the final stage of optimization in Derby is the 
 * "modification of access paths" phase, in which each node in the query 
 * tree is given a chance to modify or otherwise perform maintenance in 
 * preparation for code generation.  In the case of a UnionNode, a call 
 * to modifyAccessPaths() will bring us to the addNewNodes() method, 
 * which is where the call is made to generate the NormalizeResultSetNode.
 * 
 *
 * if (! columnTypesAndLengthsMatch())
 *           {
 *               treeTop = 
 *               (NormalizeResultSetNode) getNodeFactory().getNode(
 *               C_NodeTypes.NORMALIZE_RESULT_SET_NODE,
 *               treeTop, null, null, Boolean.FALSE,
 *               getContextManager());   
 *            }
 *
 * The fact that the left and right children of the UnionNode have different 
 * types (observation c above) means that the if condition will return 
 * true and thus we will generate a NormalizeResultSetNode above the 
 * UnionNode. At this point (before the NormalizeResultSetNode has been 
 * generated) our (simplified) query tree looks something like the following.
 *  PRN stands for ProjectRestrictNode, RCL stands for ResultColumnList:
 *
 *                      PRN0
 *                     (RCL0)
 *             (restriction: a > 28 {RCL1})
 *                       |
 *                    UnionNode          // <-- Modifying access paths...
 *                     (RCL1)
 *                    /      \
 *                  PRN2     PRN3
 *                    |        |
 *                  PRN4     PRN5
 *                    |        |
 *                    T1       T1
 *
 *
 * where 'a > 28 {RCL1}' means that the column reference A in the predicate a > 28 points to a ResultColumn object in the ResultColumnList that corresponds to "RCL1".  I.e. at this point, the predicate's column reference is pointing to an object in the UnionNode's RCL.
 * "normalize node creation"  will execute:
 *
 *        ResultColumnList prRCList = rcl;
 *       rsn.setResultColumns(rcl.copyListAndObjects());
 *       // Remove any columns that were generated.
 *       prRCList.removeGeneratedGroupingColumns();
 *       ...
 *       prRCList.genVirtualColumnNodes(rsn, rsn.getResultColumns());
 *       
 *       this.resultColumns = prRCList;
 *       
 * to create a NormalizeResultSetNode whose result column list is prRCList.  
 * This gives us:
 *
 *                      PRN0
 *                     (RCL0)
 *             (restriction: a > 28 {RCL1})
 *                       |
 *             NormalizeResultSetNode
 *                     (RCL1)              // RCL1 "pulled up" to NRSN
 *                       |
 *                   UnionNode
 *                     (RCL2)              // RCL2 is a (modified) *copy* of RCL1
 *                    /      \
 *                  PRN2     PRN3
 *                    |        |
 *                  PRN4     PRN5
 *                    |        |
 *                    T1       T1
 *
 * Note how RCL1, the ResultColumnList object for the UnionNode, has now been 
 * *MOVED* so that it belongs to the NormalizeResultSetNode.  So the predicate 
 * a > 28, which (still) points to RCL1, is now pointing to the 
 * NormalizeResultSetNode instead of to the UnionNode.
 * 
 * After this, we go back to UnionNode.addNewNodes() where we see the following:
 * 
 *
 *  treeTop = (ResultSetNode) getNodeFactory().getNode(
 *                   C_NodeTypes.DISTINCT_NODE,
 *                   treeTop.genProjectRestrict(),
 *                   Boolean.FALSE,
 *                   tableProperties,
 *                   getContextManager());
 *
 *
 * I.e. we have to generate a DistinctNode to eliminate duplicates because the query 
 * specified UNION, not UNION ALL.
 * 
 * Note the call to treeTop.genProjectRestrict().  Since NormalizeResultSetNode 
 * now sits on top of the UnionNode, treeTop is a reference to the 
 * NormalizeResultSetNode.  That means we end up at the genProjectRestrict() 
 * method of NormalizeResultSetNode.  And guess what?  The method does 
 * something very similar to what we did in NormalizeResultSetNode.init(), 
 * namely:
 *
 *   ResultColumnList prRCList = resultColumns;
 *   resultColumns = resultColumns.copyListAndObjects();
 *
 * and then creates a ProjectRestrictNode whose result column list is prRCList.  This gives us:
 *
 *                     PRN0
 *                    (RCL0)
 *             (restriction: a > 28 {RCL1})
 *                       |
 *                     PRN6
 *                    (RCL1)              // RCL1 "pulled up" to new PRN.
 *                       |
 *             NormalizeResultSetNode
 *                    (RCL3)              // RCL3 is a (modified) copy of RCL1
 *                       |
 *                   UnionNode
 *                     (RCL2)             // RCL2 is a (modified) copy of RCL1
 *                    /      \
 *                  PRN2     PRN3
 *                    |        |
 *                  PRN4     PRN5
 *                    |        |
 *                    T1       T1
 *
 * On top of that we then put a DistinctNode.  And since the init() method 
 * of DistinctNode does the same kind of thing as the previously-discussed 
 * methods, we ultimatley end up with:
 *
 *                     PRN0
 *                     (RCL0)
 *             (restriction: a > 28 {RCL1})
 *                       |
 *                  DistinctNode
 *                    (RCL1)              // RCL1 pulled up to DistinctNode
 *                       |
 *                     PRN6
 *                    (RCL4)              // RCL4 is a (modified) copy of RCL1
