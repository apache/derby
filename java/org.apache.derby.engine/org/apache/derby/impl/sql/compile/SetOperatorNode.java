		 * Ex.
		 *  select * from

		 * it can't be pushed to the VALUES clause.  This means that
		 * after we're done modifying the paths for "this" node (the top
		 * UNION), the predicate will still be sitting in our leftOptPredicates
		 * list.  If that's the case, then we have to make sure the predicate,
		 * which was _not_ enforced in the left child, is enforced at this
		 * level.  We do that by generating a ProjectRestrictNode above this
		 * node.  Yes, this means the predicate will actually be applied
		 * twice to the right child (in this case), but that's okay as it
		 * won't affect the results.

		 * all SetOpNodes that exist in the subtree rooted at this SetOpNode.
		 * Since we just modified access paths on this node, it's possible
		 * that the SetOperatorNode chain (if there was one) is now "broken"
		 * as a result of the insertion of new nodes.  For example, prior
		 * to modification of access paths we may have a chain such as:
		 *
		 *                          UnionNode (0)
		 *                          /       \
		 *                 UnionNode (1)    SelectNode (2)
		 *                 /        \ 
		 *      SelectNode (3)     SelectNode (4)
		 *
		 * Now if UnionNode(1) did not specify "ALL" then as part of the
		 * above call to modifyAccessPaths() we will have inserted a
		 * DistinctNode above it, thus giving:
		 *
		 *                          UnionNode (0)
		 *                          /       \
		 *                 DistinctNode (5)  SelectNode (2)
		 *                      |
		 *                 UnionNode (1)
		 *                 /        \ 
		 *      SelectNode (3)     SelectNode (4)
		 *
		 * So our chain of UnionNode's has now been "broken" by an intervening
		 * DistinctNode.  For this reason we can't just walk the chain of
		 * SetOperatorNodes looking for unpushed predicates (because the
		 * chain might be broken and then we could miss some nodes). Instead,
		 * we have to get a collection of all relevant nodes that exist beneath
		 * this SetOpNode and call hasUnPushedPredicates() on each one.  For
		 * now we only consider UnionNodes to be "relevant" because those are
		 * the only ones that might actually have unpushed predicates.
		 * 
		 * If we find any UnionNodes that *do* have unpushed predicates then
		 * we have to use a PRN to enforce the predicate at the level of
		 * this, the top-most, SetOperatorNode.

	 * @see org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.compile.Optimizable#pushOptPredicate
	 *
	 * Take a predicate and push it down to both the left AND right result
	 * sets.  Return "true" if we successfully pushed it to both sides,
	 * and "false" otherwise.  The assumption is that if we return "true",
	 * the caller will take the predicate and remove it from its own list
	 * of predicates to evaluate; if we return false, then the predicate
	 * will be evaluated at the level of the caller.  So returning "false"
	 * means that the left and right result sets for this node will be fully
	 * returned, and then the predicate will be evaluated against the
	 * <set-operator> of those result sets (as of DERBY-805, the only set
	 * operator calling this method is UnionNode).  If we can push the
	 * predicate down to both children, though, we can evaluate it closer
	 * to store, which means that each child result set returns only the
	 * correctly qualified rows, and thus the calling set operator will
	 * have a smaller result set on which to operate, which can boost
	 * performance.
	 *
	 * That said, if we can't push the predicate to _both_ sides, we don't
	 * push it at all.  The reason is that if we push to one side but not
	 * to the other, we would have to ask the question of whether we should
	 * return "true" (meaning that the predicate would be removed from the
	 * caller's list and thus would _not_ be evaluated at the <set-operator>
	 * level) or "false" (meaning that the caller would keep the predicate
	 * and evaluate it at the <set-operator> level).  Depending on the query
	 * in question, both answers could end up returning incorrect results.
	 *
	 * For example, if we push it to the right but not to the left, then
	 * leave it in the caller's list, the optimizer for the caller might
	 * decide to use the predicate to do a hash join with some outer result
	 * set (if the predicate is an equijoin predicate).  That would result
	 * in materialization of the calling node and of its children--but since
	 * we pushed a predicate that depends on the outer table down into the
	 * right child, materialization of the right child will only return the
	 * rows that join with the _first_ row of the outer result set, which 
	 * is wrong.
	 *
	 * If, on the other hand, we push the predicate to one side and then tell
	 * the caller to remove it from its list, the side to which we did _not_
	 * push the predicate could return rows that aren't qualified.  Then,
	 * since the caller removed the predicate from its list, it (the caller)
	 * will not evaluate the predicate on its own result set--and thus we
	 * can end up returning rows that we weren't supposed to return.
	 * 
	 * So all of that said, only push (and return "true") if we think we
	 * can push the predicate to both sides.

	 *
	 * NOTE: No transformation is performed if the ResultColumn.expression is

	 * 
	 * This method is used during binding of EXISTS predicates to map
	 * a subquery's result column list into a single TRUE node.  For
	 * SELECT and VALUES subqueries this transformation is pretty
	 * straightforward.  But for set operators (ex. INTERSECT) we have
	 * to do some extra work.  To see why, assume we have the following
	 * query:
	 *
	 *  select * from ( values 'BAD' ) as T
	 *    where exists ((values 1) intersect (values 2))
	 *
	 * If we treated the INTERSECT in this query the same way that we
	 * treat SELECT/VALUES subqueries then the above query would get
	 * transformed into:
	 *
	 *  select * from ( values 'BAD' ) as T
	 *    where ((values TRUE) intersect (values TRUE))
	 *
	 * Since both children of the INTERSECT would then have the same value,
	 * the result of set operation would be a single value (TRUE), which
	 * means the WHERE clause would evaluate to TRUE and thus the query
	 * would return one row with value 'BAD'.  That would be wrong.
	 *
	 * To avoid this problem, we internally wrap this SetOperatorNode
	 * inside a "SELECT *" subquery and then we change the new SelectNode's
	 * result column list (as opposed to *this* nodes' result column list)
	 * to a singe boolean true node:
	 *
	 *  select * from ( values 'BAD' ) as T where
	 *      SELECT TRUE FROM ((values 1) intersect (values 2))
	 *
	 * In this case the left and right children of the INTERSECT retain
	 * their values, which ensures that the result of the intersect
	 * operation will be correct.  Since (1 intersect 2) is an empty
	 * result set, the internally generated SELECT node will return
	 * zero rows, which in turn means the WHERE predicate will return
	 * NULL (an empty result set from a SubqueryNode is treated as NULL
	 * at execution time; see impl/sql/execute/AnyResultSet). Since
	 * NULL is not the same as TRUE the query will correctly return
