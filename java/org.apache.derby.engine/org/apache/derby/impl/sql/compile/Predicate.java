	 * But when remapping a scoped predicate, things are slightly
	 * different.  This method handles remapping of scoped predicates.
	 *
	 * We know that, for a scoped predicate, exactly one operand has
	 * been scoped for a specific target result set; the other operand
	 * is pointing to some other instance of FromTable with which the
	 * target result set is to be joined (see getScopedOperand() in

	 * query through which the scoped predicate is pushed, we have
	 * to perform a remap operation of the scoped operand.  We do
	 * *not*, however, remap the non-scoped operand.  The reason
	 * is that the non-scoped operand is already pointing to the
	 * result set against which it must be evaluated.  As the scoped
	 * predicate is pushed down the query tree, the non-scoped
	 * operand should not change where it's pointing and thus should
	 * not be remapped.  For example, assume we have a query whose
	 * tree has the following form:
	 *
	 *               SELECT[0] 
	 *                /     \ 
	 *              PRN      PRN 
	 *               |        |
	 *          SELECT[4]   UNION
	 *           |           /   \ 
	 *          PRN     SELECT[1]  SELECT[2] 
	 *           |         |          | 
	 *       [FBT:T1]     PRN        PRN 
	 *                     |          |
	 *                SELECT[3]  [FromBaseTable:T2]
	 *                     |
	 *                    PRN
	 *                     |
	 *             [FromBaseTable:T3]
	 *
	 * Assume also that we have some predicate "SELECT[4].i = <UNION>.j".
	 * If the optimizer decides to push the predicate to the UNION
	 * node, it (the predicate) will be scoped to the UNION's children,
	 * yielding something like "SELECT[4].i = SELECT[1].j" for the
	 * left child and "SELECT[4].i = SELECT[2].j" for the right child.
	 * These scoped predicates will then be pushed to the PRNs above
	 * SELECT[3] and T2, respectively.  As part of that pushing
	 * process a call to PRN.pushOptPredicate() will occur, which
	 * brings us to this method.  So let's assume we're here for
	 * the scoped predicate "SELECT[4].i = SELECT[1].j".  Then we want
	 * to remap the scoped operand, "SELECT[1].j", so that it will
	 * point to the correct column in "SELECT[3]".  We do NOT, however,
	 * want to remap the non-scoped operand "SELECT[4].i" because that
	 * operand is already pointing to the correct result set--namely,
	 * to a column in SELECT[4].  That non-scoped operand should not
	 * change regardless of how far down the UNION subtree the scoped
	 * predicate is pushed.
	 * 
	 * If we did try to remap the non-scoped operand, it would end up
	 * pointing to result sets too low in the tree, which could lead to
	 * execution-time errors.  So when we remap a scoped predicate, we
	 * have to make sure we only remap the scoped operand.  That's what
	 * this method does.
	 *
	 * @return True if this predicate is a scoped predicate, in which
