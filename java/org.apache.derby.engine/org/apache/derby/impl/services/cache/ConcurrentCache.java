 * access the cache concurrently without blocking each other, given that they
 * request different objects and the requested objects are present in the
 * cache.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * All methods of this class should be thread safe. When exclusive access to an
 * entry is required, it is achieved by calling the <code>lock()</code> method
 * on the <code>CacheEntry</code> object. To ensure that the entry is always
 * unlocked, all calls to <code>CacheEntry.lock()</code> should be followed by
 * a <code>try</code> block with a <code>finally</code> clause that unlocks the
 * entry.
