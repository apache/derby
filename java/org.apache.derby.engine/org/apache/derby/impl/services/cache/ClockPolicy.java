/**
 * Implementation of a replacement policy which uses the clock algorithm. All
 * the cache entries are stored in a circular buffer, called the clock. There
 * is also a clock hand which points to one of the entries in the clock. Each
 * time an entry is accessed, it is marked as recently used. If a new entry is
 * inserted into the cache and the cache is full, the clock hand is moved until
 * it is over a not recently used entry, and that entry is evicted to make
 * space for the new entry. Each time the clock hand sweeps over a recently
 * used entry, it is marked as not recently used, and it will be a candidate
 * for removal the next time the clock hand sweeps over it, unless it has been
 * marked as recently used in the meantime.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * To allow concurrent access from multiple threads, the methods in this class
 * need to synchronize on a number of different objects:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li><code>CacheEntry</code> objects must be locked before they can be
 * used</li>
 *
 * <li>accesses to the clock structure (circular buffer + clock hand) should be
 * synchronized on the <code>ArrayList</code> representing the circular
 * buffer</li>
 *
 * <li>accesses to individual <code>Holder</code> objects in the clock
 * structure should be protected by synchronizing on the holder</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, we need to ensure that all threads obtain
 * synchronization locks in the same order. <code>CacheEntry</code>'s class
 * javadoc dictates the order when locking <code>CacheEntry</code>
 * objects. Additionally, we require that no thread should obtain any other
 * synchronization locks while it is holding a synchronization lock on the
 * clock structure or on a <code>Holder</code> object. The threads are however
 * allowed to obtain synchronization locks on the clock structure or on a
 * holder while they are locking one or more <code>CacheEntry</code> objects.
