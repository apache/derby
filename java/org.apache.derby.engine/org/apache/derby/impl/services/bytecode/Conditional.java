/**
	A Conditional represents an if/then/else block.
	When this is created the code  will already have
	the conditional check code. The code is optimized for branch
	offsets that fit in 2 bytes, though will handle 4 byte offsets.
<code>
     if condition
	 then code
	 else code
</code>
     what actually gets built is
<code>
     if !condition branch to eb:
	  then code
	  goto end:  // skip else
	 eb:
	  else code
	 end:
</code>

    If no else condition was provided then the code is:
    
<code>
     if !condition branch to end:
	  then code
	 end:
</code>

Note all branches here are using relative offsets, not absolute program counters.

//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
If the then code leads to the conditional branch offset being too big (&gt;32k)
because the then code is larger than 32767 bytes then this is built:
<code>
     // when else code is present
     if condition branch to tb: (relative offset +8)
     goto_w eb: // indirect for else block (5 bytes)
     tb:
	    then code (&gt; 32767 bytes)
	    goto end:
	 eb:
	  else code
	 end:
</code>

<code>
     // when only then code is present
     if condition branch to tb: (relative offset +8)
     goto_w end: // indirect for else block (5 bytes)
     tb:
	    then code (&gt; 32767 bytes)
	 end:
</code>

If there is an else branch and only it is larger than 32767 bytes then
the code is:

<code>
     if !condition branch to eb: (offset increased by two over previous value)
	  then code
	  goto_w end:  // skip else
	 eb:
	  else code (&gt; 32767 bytes)
	 end:
</code>

This has one special case where the size of conditional branch to eb:
now must change from a 16bit value to a 32 bit value. The generated code
for this is the same as when both the then code and the else code require
32bit offsets for the branches. This code is:

<code>
     if condition branch to tb: (relative offset +8)
     goto_w eb: // indirect for else block (5 bytes)
     tb:
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
	    then code (&gt; 32767 bytes)
	    goto_w end:
	 eb:
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6856
	  else code (&gt; 32767 bytes)
	 end:
</code>

In theory, at the moment this should not happen as this would mean a total
code size that exceeds the limit on the code size for a method (64k). This
code handles this case as it does occur if the limit for a branch is lowered
for testing purposes, to ensure the complete set of branch re-write code works.
This lowering of the limit can be done by changing the constant BRANCH16LIMIT.
