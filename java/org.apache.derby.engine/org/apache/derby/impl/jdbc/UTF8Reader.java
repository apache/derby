/**
 * Class for reading characters from streams encoded in the modified UTF-8
 * format.
 * <p>
 * Note that we often operate on a special Derby stream.
 * A Derby stream is possibly different from a "normal" stream in two ways;
 * an encoded length is inserted at the head of the stream, and if the encoded
 * length is <code>0</code> a Derby-specific end of stream marker is appended
 * to the data.
 * <p>
 * If the underlying stream is capable of repositioning itself on request,
 * this class supports multiple readers on the same source stream in such a way
 * that the various readers do not interfere with each other (except for
 * serializing access). Each reader instance will have its own pointer into the
 * stream, and request that the stream repositions itself before calling
 * read/skip on the stream.
