/**
 * A wrapper-stream able to reposition the underlying store stream.
 * <p>
 * Where a user expects the underlying stream to be at a given position,
 * {@link #reposition} must be called with the expected position first. A use
 * case for this scenario is the LOB objects, where you can request a stream and
 * at the same time (this does not mean concurrently) query the LOB about its
 * length or ask to get a part of the LOB returned. Such multiplexed operations
 * must result in consistent and valid data, and to achieve this the underlying
 * store stream must be able to reposition itself.
 *
 * <em>Synchronization</em>: Access to instances of this class must be
 * externally synchronized on the connection synchronization object. There are
 * two reasons for this:
 * <ul> <li>Access to store must be single threaded.
 *      <li>This class is not thread safe, and calling the various methods from
 *          different threads concurrently can result in inconsistent position
 *          values. To avoid redundant internal synchronization, this class
 *          assumes and <b>requires</b> external synchronization (also called
 *          client-side locking).
 * </ul>
