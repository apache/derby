/**
 * This interface provides basic storage functions needed for read only databases. Most storage
 * implementations will be read-write and implement the WritableStorageFactory extension of this
 * interface.
 *
 *<p>
 * The database engine uses this interface to access storage. The normal database engine
 * implements this interface using disk files and the standard java.io classes.
 *
 *<p>
 * The storage factory must implement writable temporary files, even if the database is read-only or
 * if the storage factory is read-only (i.e. it does not implement the WritableStorageFactory extension of this
 * interface). Temporary files are those created under the temporary file directory. See
 * {@link #getTempDir method getTempDir()}.
 *
 *<p>The database engine can be turned into a RAM based engine by providing a RAM based implementation of this interface.
 *
 *<p>There is one instance of the StorageFactory per database if the log files are kept in the database directory.
 * If the log files are kept on a separate device then a second StorageFactory is instantiated to hold the log files.
 * The database or log device name is set when the init method is called.
 * The init method is called once per instance, before any other StorageFactory method.
 *
 *<p>The class implementing this interface must have a public niladic constructor. The init method will be called
 * before any other method to set the database directory name, to tell the factory to create the database
 * directory if necessary, and to allow the implementation to perform any initializations it requires. The
 * database name set in the init method forms a separate name space. Different StorageFactory instances, with
 * different database directory names, must ensure that their files do not clash. So, for instance,
 * storageFactory1.newStorageFile( "x") must be a separate file from storageFactory2.newStorageFile( "x").
 *
 *<p>The database engine will call this interface's methods from its own privilege blocks. This does not give
 * a StorageFactory implementation carte blanche: a security manager can still forbid the implemeting class from
 * executing a privileged action. However, the security manager will not look in the calling stack beyond the
 * database engine.
 *
 *<p>Each StorageFactory instance may be concurrently used by multiple threads. Each StorageFactory implementation
 * must be thread safe.
 *
 *<p>A StorageFactory implementation is plugged into the database engine via a sub-protocol. Sub-protocol <i>xxx</i> is
 * tied to a StorageFactory implementation class via the derby.subSubProtocol.<i>xxx</i> system property. So,
 * to use StorageFactory implementation class MyStorageFactory with database myDB you would set the system
 * property "derby.subSubProtocol.mysf=MyStorageFactory" and use the URL "jdbc:derby:mysf:myDB" to
 * connect to the database.
