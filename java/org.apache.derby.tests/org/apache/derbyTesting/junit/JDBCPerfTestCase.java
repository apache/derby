/**
 * Base Class for performance tests. It is useful for a performance test
 * framework to have ability to run a test for I iterations , and repeat the
 * test R times. This class provides this functionality of timing the test for I
 * iterations and repeating the test in the same jvm for R number of
 * times. 
 * 
 * For JDBCPerfTestCase with R repeats and I iterations
 * 
 * This cycle is repeated R times 
 * {
 *    setUp run once 
 *    fixture method is run I times(and timed) 
 *    tearDown is run once
 * }
 *
 * 
 * Results are printed out to System.out currently. For each repeat of the test, 
 * the elapsed time is printed out and after R repeats of the test, the average
 * elapsed time is also printed.
 *  
 * If  a test has R repeats and (R&gt;1), then the average elapsed time of the
 * (R-1) runs is printed out and the timing info collected as part of the first 
 * testrun is ignored. 
 * If R=1, then the average elapsed time prints time for that
 * only run. 
 * 
 * To see the current output that is printed out, see methods runBare() and 
 * runTest()
 * 
 * To write a performance test, extend the JDBCPerfTestCase 
 * In the example below, ScanCoveredIdxTest is a performance test that 
 * extends JDBCPerfTestCase. See below code snippet on how 
 * these tests will be added/used.  
 * <CODE>
 *  // Add a test fixture 'scanAllRows' in ScanCoveredIdxTest 
 *  // and to run this test for 100 iterations and to 
 *  // repeat the test 4 times.
 *  int iterations = 100; 
 *  int repeats = 4; 
 *  BaseTestSuite suite = new BaseTestSuite();
 *  suite.addTest(new ScanCoveredIdxTest("scanAllRows",iterations,repeats));
 * 
 *  // To add client tests. 
 * BaseTestSuite client = new BaseTestSuite("Client");
 * client.addTest(new ScanCoveredIdxTest("scanAllRows",iterations,repeats));
 * client.addTest(new ScanCoveredIdxTest("scanAndRetrieveAllRows",iterations,repeats));
 * 
 * // This will add the server decorator that will start the
 * // server on setUp of the suite and stop server on tearDown 
 * // of the suite.
 * suite.addTest(TestConfiguration.clientServerDecorator(client));
 * </CODE>
 * 
 * Some improvement areas/ideas: 
 * -- Can we use TestResult ,and our own TestRunner to improve on how the 
 * results are reported.  
 * -- write the perf results to a file that can be easily consumed for reporting purposes
 * and further analysis against different builds.
 * -- Maybe even write the results out in xml format,and then using xsl the results
 * could be rendered into html reports
