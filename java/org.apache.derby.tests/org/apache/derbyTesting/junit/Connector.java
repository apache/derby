 * Factory for getting connections within the tests that is designed
 * for the simple working case for most tests. Most tests just
 * need to connect or shutdown the database, this hides through
 * BaseJDBCTestCase and TestConfiguration the details of how
 * those operations are performed.
 * <P>
 * Tests that need finer control over the connection handling
 * should use the JDBC classes directly, such as DriverManager
 * or DataSource.
 * <P>
 * This is split out into an interface and sub-classes to
 * ensure that no ClassNotFoundExceptions are thrown when
 * running in an JSR 169 environment and DriverManager is
 * not available.
