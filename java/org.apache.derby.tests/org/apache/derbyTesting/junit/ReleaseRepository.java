/**
 * A repository for Derby releases.
 * <p>
 * The releases are used by tests, for instance by the upgrade and compatibility
 * tests, to verify characteristics and behavior across Derby releases.
 * <p>
 * This particular repository is rather dumb - it is up to the user to keep the
 * repository content updated. The repository layout is based on the layout of
 * the SVN repository for releases at
 * {@code https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/jars}. This means there will
 * be a directory for each release, where the directory name is the release
 * version. Inside this directory, all the distribution JARs can be found.
 * <p>
 * The repository location defaults to {@code $HOME/.derbyTestingReleases} on
 * UNIX-like systems, and to {@code %UserProfile%\.derbyTestingReleases} on
 * Windows (in Java, both of these maps to the system property 'user.home').
 * The location can be overridden by specifying the system property
 * {@code derbyTesting.oldReleasePath}.
 * <p>
 * If the default location doesn't exist, and the system property
 * {@code derbyTesting.oldReleasePath} is unspecified, it is up to the tests
 * using the release repository to decide if this condition fails the test or
 * not. If the system property is set to a non-existing directory an exception
 * will be thrown when instantiating the repository.
 * <p>
 * The repository is lazily initialized, as there's no reason to incur the
 * initialization cost when running tests that don't require the repository.
 * The disk is inspected only when the repository is instantiated, any updates
 * to the on-disk repository after the repository has been instantiated will
 * not take effect.
 * <p>
 * <em>Implementation note</em>: This code should be runnable with J2ME, which
 * means that it needs to be compatible with J2SE 1.4 for the time being.
