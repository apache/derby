     * See 
     * <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2480">DERBY-2480</a>
     * for details.</p>
     * <p>This test fixture is currently not part of any large JUnit suite
     * because <b>1)</b> the default number of connection attempts is rather
     * large, and takes some time to complete (depending on hardware), and 
     * <b>2)</b> if the tested Derby version is still vulnerable to DERBY-2480
     * or similar issues the JVM will most likely run out of memory (depending
     * on heap settings), causing subsequent tests to fail, hang or not run at
     * all.</p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> The JVM may slow down significantly (even appear to hang)
     * before an OOME is thrown. Depending on the avaliable resources, the error
     * may or may not be reported in the logs (derby.log, server console).</p>
     * <p>
     * This fixture requires java.sql.DriverManager. This is because simple
     * and easy control of the connection handling and database creation is 
     * desired (see implementation comments). However, the test logic itself 
     * should also work with other connection mechanisms.</p>

     *         examined using assertions.
