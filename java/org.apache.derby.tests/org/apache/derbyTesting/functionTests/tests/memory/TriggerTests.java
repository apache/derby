	 * Insert trigger tests
	 * ****************
	 * 1)test1InsertAfterTrigger
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER INSERT trigger which inserts non-lob
	 * columns into another table.
	 * ****************
	 * 2)test1InsertAfterTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1InsertAfterTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1InsertAfterTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * 3)test1InsertBeforeTrigger
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE INSERT trigger which selects 
	 * columns from another table using "new" non-lob column for 
	 * join clause. 
	 * ****************
	 * 4)test1InsertBeforeTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1InsertBeforeTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1InsertBeforeTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * Can't write stored procedure calls for trigger actions for test2
	 * because I will need to pass LOBs as parameters to the stored
	 * procedure which is not possible at this point.
	 * ****************
	 * 5)test2InsertAfterTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER INSERT trigger which in it's trigger action
	 * inserts lob columns from triggering table into another table. So, this
	 * test does access the LOB from the triggering table inside the trigger
	 * action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 6)test2InsertAfterTriggerUpdatedLOB
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER INSERT trigger which in it's trigger action
	 * updates a lob column from the row just inserted. So, this test does
	 * update the LOB from the triggering table inside the trigger
	 * action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 7)test2InsertBeforeTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE INSERT trigger which selects "new"
	 * lob column from just inserted row. This test does access the
	 * LOB.
	 * ****************
	 * 8)test5InsertAfterTriggerNoReferencingClause
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER INSERT trigger but has not REFERENCING
	 * clause, meaning that before and after values are not available to
	 * the trigger action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 9)test5InsertBeforeTriggerNoReferencingClause
	 * 	This test creates an BEFORE INSERT trigger but has no REFERENCING
	 * clause, meaning that before and after values are not available to

	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Delete trigger tests
	 * ****************
	 * 1)test1DeleteAfterTrigger
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER DELETE trigger which delets from another
	 * table using non-lob from the triggering table in the where clause.
	 * ****************
	 * 2)test1DeleteAfterTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1DeleteAfterTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1DeleteAfterTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************

	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1DeleteBeforeTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1DeleteBeforeTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * Can't write stored procedure calls for trigger actions for test2
	 * because I will need to pass LOBs as parameters to the stored
	 * procedure which is not possible at this point.
	 * ****************
	 * 5)test2DeleteAfterTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER DELETE trigger which in it's trigger action
	 * deletes row from another table using triggering table's "new" LOB value
	 * in the join clause. So, this test does access the LOB from the 
	 * triggering table inside the trigger action.
	 * ****************
	 * ****************
	 * 6)test2DeleteBeforeTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE DELETE trigger which selects "old"
	 * lob column from just deleted row. This test does access the
	 * LOB.
	 * ****************
	 * 7)test5DeleteAfterTriggerNoReferencingClause
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER DELETE trigger but has no REFERENCING
	 * clause, meaning that before and after values are not available to
	 * the trigger action.

	 * 
	 * Update trigger tests
	 * ****************
	 * 1)test1UpdateAfterTrigger -
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER UPDATE trigger which is declared on a
	 * non-LOB column. The trigger action does not access the LOB column.
	 * ****************
	 * 2)test1UpdateAfterTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1UpdateAfterTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1UpdateAfterTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * 3)test1UpdateBeforeTrigger
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE UPDATE trigger which is declared
	 * on a non-LOB column. The trigger action selects columns from 
	 * another table using "new" non-lob column for join clause. 
	 * ****************
	 * 4)test1UpdateBeforeTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test1UpdateBeforeTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test1UpdateBeforeTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * Can't write stored procedure calls for trigger actions for test2
	 * because I will need to pass LOBs as parameters to the stored
	 * procedure which is not possible at this point.
	 * ****************
	 * 5)test2UpdateAfterTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	The after update trigger on non-LOB column but the LOB column is
	 * referenced in the trigger action. So, this test does access the LOB 
	 * from the triggering table inside the trigger action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 6)test2UpdateAfterTriggerUpdatedLOB
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER UPDATE trigger which in it's trigger action
	 * updates a lob column from the row that just got updated. So, this test 
	 * does update the LOB from the triggering table inside the trigger
	 * action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 7)test2UpdateBeforeTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE UPDATE trigger which selects "new"
	 * lob column from just updated row. This test does access the
	 * LOB. 
	 * ****************
	 * 8)test3UpdateAfterTrigger
	 * 	The after update trigger is defined on LOB column but the LOB column 
	 * is not referenced in the trigger action.
	 * ****************
	 * 9)test3UpdateAfterTriggerStoredProc
	 *  The test case is exactly like test3UpdateAfterTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test3UpdateAfterTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * 10)test3UpdateBeforeTrigger
	 * 	This test creates a BEFORE UPDATE trigger which selects a row
	 * from another table using "new" non-LOB column from the triggering
	 * table. This test has update trigger defined on the LOB column
	 * but does not access/update that LOB column in the trigger action.
	 * ****************
	 * 11)test3UpdateBeforeTriggerStoredProc
	 * 	The test case is exactly like test3UpdateBeforeTrigger except that the
	 * trigger action is a stored procedure call. The work done by the trigger
	 * action SQL in test3UpdateBeforeTrigger gets done inside the stored procedure
	 * for this test.
	 * ****************
	 * 12)test4UpdateAfterTriggerAccessLOB
	 * 	The after update trigger on LOB column but the LOB column is referenced 
	 * in the trigger action. This is one case though where we do need to keep 
	 * before and after image since the LOB got updated and it is being used in 
	 * trigger action.
	 * ****************
	 * 13)test4UpdateAfterTriggerUpdatedLOB
	 * 	The after update trigger on LOB column which then gets updated in the
	 * trigger action. So this test updates the LOB in the trigger action
	 * and is also the cause of the update trigger to fire. 
	 * ****************
	 * 14)test4UpdateBeforeTrigger
	 * ****************
	 * 15)test5UpdateAfterTriggerNoReferencingClause
	 * 	This test creates an AFTER UPDATE trigger but has no REFERENCING
	 * clause, meaning that before and after values are not available to
	 * the trigger action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 16)test5UpdateBeforeTriggerNoReferencingClause
	 * 	This test creates an BEFORE UPDATE trigger but has no REFERENCING
	 * clause, meaning that before and after values are not available to
	 * the trigger action. 
	 * ****************
	 * 17)test6UpdateAfterTriggerNoTriggerColumn
	 *  This test create an AFTER UPDATE trigger but does not identify any
	 * trigger columns. It has REFERENCING clause. Void of trigger columns
	 * will cause all the columns to be read into memory.
