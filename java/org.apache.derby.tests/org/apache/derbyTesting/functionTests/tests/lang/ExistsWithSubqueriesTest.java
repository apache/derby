/**
 * This test contains a variety of cases of EXISTS predicates with subqueries.
 *
 * Several tests ensure that an EXISTS predicate which wraps a set operation--
 * meaning a UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT node--returns the correct results.
 * For example:
 *
 *   select * from ( values 'BAD' ) as T
 *     where exists ((values 1) intersect (values 2))
 *
 * should return zero rows. Prompted by DERBY-2370.
 *
 * A somewhat unrelated test verifies the DERBY-3033 behavior, which
 * involves flattening of subqueries with NOT EXISTS predicates. The
 * issue here is that a flattened NOT EXISTS subquery cannot be used
 * to perform equi-join transitive closure, because the implied predicate
 * that results from the flattening is a NOT EQUALS condition.
