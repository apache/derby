/**
 * This test checks to make sure that the XML data type and
 * the corresponding XML operations all work as expected
 * from the JDBC side of things.  In particular, this test
 * verifies that 1) it is NOT possible to bind to/from an XML
 * datatype (because such an operation requires JDBC 4.0 and
 * is not yet supported by Derby), and 2) the correct behavior
 * occurs when null values (both Java and SQL) are bound
 * into the bindable parameters for the XML operators.
 *
 * This test also checks that insertion from XML files
 * via a character stream works, which is important since
 * XML files can be arbitrarily long and thus stream-based
 * processing is a must.
