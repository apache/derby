/**
 * <p>
 * This JUnit test class is for testing the JDBCMBean that is available in
 * Derby. Running these tests requires a JVM supporting J2SE 5.0 or better, due 
 * to the implementation's dependency of the platform management agent.</p>
 * <p>
 * This class currently tests the following:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>That the attributes we expect to be available exist</li>
 *   <li>That these attributes are readable</li>
 *   <li>That these attributes have the correct type</li>
 *   <li>That these attributes have the correct value</li>
 *   <li>That the MBean operations we expect to see are invokeable, and that
 *       their return values are as expected.</li>
 * <p>
 * The test fixtures will fail if an exception occurs (will be reported as an 
 * error in JUnit).</p>
