/**

The purpose of this test space reclamation of long rows and long columns.
This addresses DERBY-670.

The main issue is that previous to fixes for DERBY-670, space reclamation
was only automatically queued when the last row on a page was deleted.  In
the case of long columns, the actual row on the main page can be quite small
as the long data is streamed onto other pages.  So the table can grow 
unexpectedly quite large before the default space reclamation kicks in.  The
change queues space reclamation in the case of long columns (blob/clob),
immediately post commit of the single delete.
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6709

The testing strategy is to loop doing insert, delete, commit of a blob for
a number of iterations and check that the actual size of the table is 
reasonable.  A sleep will be added to allow time for post commit to catch up
as the test may be run in a number of environments with varying performance
of background activities.
