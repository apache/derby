/**
 * This class is used to test the fix for DERBY-694.
 *
 * A brief description of DERBY-694 (Got from the description in JIRA)
 *
 * 1) Autocommit off.
 * 2) Have two prepared statements, calling executeQuery() on both
 * 3) Gives two result sets. Can fetch data from both with next().
 * 4) If one statement gets an exception (say, caused by a division by zero)
 * 5) not only this statement's result set is closed, but also the other open
 *    resultset. This happens with the client driver, whereas in embedded mode,
 *    the other result set is unaffected by the exception in the first result set
 *    (as it should be).
