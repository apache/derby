	 *Followng call waits until post commit thread queue is empty.
	 *This call is useful for tests which checks for the following type
	 *of cases:
	 *  1) Checking for space usage after delete statements
	 *  2) Checking for locks when delete statements are involved,
	 *     because post commit thread might be holding locks when
	 *     checking for snap shot of locks, so best thing to do
	 *     to get consistent results is to call the following function
	 *     before checking for locks (eg: store/updatelocks.sql)
	 *  3) Depending on whethere the  space is not released yet by the post commit thread
	 *     for commited deletes or not can change the order of rows in the heap.
	 *     In such cases , it is good idea to call this method before doing
	 *     inserts(Even adding/dropping constraints can have effect because they
	 *     do inderectly deletes/inserts on system tables.) eg: lang/fk_nonsps.sql
