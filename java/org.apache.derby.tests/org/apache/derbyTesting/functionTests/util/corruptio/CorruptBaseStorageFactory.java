     *                      to deal with the directory containing the databases.
     * @param tempDirName   The name of the temporary file directory set in 
     *                      properties. If null then a default directory should
     *                      be used. Each database should get a separate

     *                      collisions.
     *
     * @param uniqueName    A unique name that can be used to create the 
     *                      temporary file directory for this database.
