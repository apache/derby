/**
 * This class provides proxy implementation of the StorageFactory
 * interface for testing. 
 *
 * Storage Factory is used by the database engine to access 
 * persistent data and transaction logs. By default all the method calls
 * delegate the work to the real disk storage factory
 * (org.apache.derby.impl.io.DirStorageFactory)
 * based on the classes in the java.io packgs. In some cases this  factory
 * instruments some methods to corrupt the io to simulate disk corruptions for
 * testing. For example to simulate out of order partial writes to disk before
 * the crash. 
 * 
 * Derby by default uses the storage factory implementation in 
 * DirStorageFactory/DirStorageFactory4 when a database is accessed with 
 * "jdbc:derby:<databaseName>". This factory can be specified instead using 
 * derby.subSubProtocol.<sub protocol name>  For example:
 *
 *  derby.subSubProtocol.csf=org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.
 *             util.corruptio.CorruptDiskStorageFactory
 *  database need to be accessed by specifying the subporotocol name like
 *  'jdbc:derby:csf:wombat'.
 *
 * Interaction between the tests that requires instrumenting the i/o and 
 * this factory is through the flags in CorruptibleIo class. Tests should not 
 * call the methods in this factory directly. Database engine invokes the 
 * methods in this factory, so they can instrumented to do whatever is 
 * required for testing.
