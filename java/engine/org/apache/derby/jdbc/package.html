<P>
Derby's JDBC api is defined by its entry point classes, the drivers and data source implementations
and the standard JDBC api definitions of the <code>java.sql</code> and <code>javax.sql</code> classes.
Derby does not provide non-standard extensions to standard JDBC classes such as <code>Connection</code>,
to encourage portable JDBC applications.
