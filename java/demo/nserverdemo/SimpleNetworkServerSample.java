/**
 * In order for a database to be consistent, only one JVM is allowed
 * to access it at a time. The embedded driver is loaded when the Network Server
 * is started. Hence, the JVM that starts the Network Server can get an
 * embedded connection to the same database that Network Server is accessing
 * to serve the clients from other JVMs. This solution allows you to take
 * advantage of the performance benefits of the embedded driver as well as allow
 * for client connections from other JVMs to connect to the same database.
 *
 *
 * In particular, this sample program
 * 1) 	starts the Derby Network Server using a property and
 *		also loads the embedded driver
 * 2)	checks if the Derby Network Server is up and running
 * 3)	creates the database 'NSSimpleDB' if not already created
 * 4)	obtains an embedded database connection
 * 5)	tests the database connection by executing a sample query
 * 6)	allows for client connections to connect to the server until
 *      the user decides to stop the server and exit the program
 * 7)	closes the connections
 * 8)	shuts down the Derby Network Server before exiting the program.
 *
 * Note: On running this program, there will be a NSSimpleDB database directory
 * created if not present already, and there will be a derby.log file which
 * contains messages from Derby.
 *
 *  <P>
 *  Usage: java SimpleNetworkServerSample
