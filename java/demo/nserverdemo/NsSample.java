/**

 The Network Server sample demo program is a
 simple JDBC application that interacts with the Derby Network Server.
 The program:

 1.	starts the Derby Network Server
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6459
 2. creates the database if not already created
 3. checks to see if the schema is already created, and if not,
 4. creates the schema which includes the table SAMPLETBL and corresponding indexes.
 5. connects to the database
 6. loads the schema by inserting data
 7. starts client threads to perform database related operations
 8. has each of the clients perform DML operations (select, insert, delete, update) using JDBC calls,
    i)	 one client opens an embedded connection to perform database operations
         You can open an embedded connection in the same JVM that starts the Derby Network
         Server.
    ii)  one client opens a client connection to the Derby Network Server to perform database operations.
 9. waits for the client threads to finish the tasks
 10.shuts down the Derby Network Server at the end of the demo

 <P>
 Usage: java nserverdemo.NsSample
 <P>
 Please note, a file derby.log is created in the directory you run this program.
 This file contains the logging of connections made with the derby network server
