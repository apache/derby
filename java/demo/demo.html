<H1>Example Apache Derby Programs</H1>
<p>In this distribution of Apache Derby, the directory
<em class="fileName">demo/programs/</em> contains example databases and programs
written in Java. Some of the sample programs are used as references in some of
the Derby user manuals,
see <A href="../../docs/html/getstart/index.html">Getting Started with Apache Derby</A> and 
the <A href="../../docs/html/adminguide/index.html">Apache Derby Server and Administration Guide</A>.
Other programs are simply demonstrations of how to get started using Derby,
or how to utilize certain features.</p>

<LI><A href="simple/example.html">Simple</A>
        <p class="BodyRelative">A very simple JDBC application that boots the driver,
        creates a database, and loads some data. This application can run in both
        embedded and client/server settings.</p>
</LI>
<li><a href="simplemobile/readme.html">Simple Mobile Demo</a>
    <p class="BodyRelative">A simple JDBC application for Java ME (J2ME) environments.
    This demo application uses Derby's EmbeddedSimpleDataSource to create a database and
    insert, modify and retreive some data.</p>
</li>
<LI><A href="nserverdemo/readme.html">Network Server Sample Programs</A>
	<p class="BodyRelative">Two examples are provided to demonstrate how to obtain an <em class="Emphasis">embedded connection</em> 
and <em class="Emphasis">client connections</em> using the Network Server to connect to the same database. 
An embedded connection is a connection to a database that is booted in the same JVM as the application. 
Client applications that require a database connection across the network use the network server protocol (DRDA) 
to connect to the Network Server. This type of connection is referred to as a client connection.</p></LI>
<LI><A href="toursdb/toursdb_readme.html">ToursDB sample database schema</a>
    <p class="BodyRelative">The toursdb is provided as an example and demo database to illustrate some 
functionality of the Derby RDBMS. Many of the examples in the Derby documentation use tables that exist in the toursdb database. 
The document describes the tables, the names and types of columns in those tables, and the constraints, indexes, and triggers in the database.

<LI><A href="workingwithderby/readme.html">Getting Started With Derby</A>
        <p class="BodyRelative">Programs described and modified as part of the activities documented in 
the <A href="../../docs/html/getstart/index.html">Getting Started With Derby</A> manual.</p>
</LI>
<LI><A href="localcal/README" type="text/plain">LocalCalendar</A>
<p class="BodyRelative">The LocalCalendar application demonstrates the
embedded/offline capabilities of Derby through a sample application that
lets you manage GoogleCalendar events offline and synchronize when
you come back online.</p>
</LI>
<LI><A href="scores/README" type="text/plain">Scores</A>
<p class="BodyRelative">
From Apachecon 2006 (Austin), this demo shows how to use user-coded Java
functions and procedures inside the Derby engine.
</p>
</LI>
<LI><A href="vtis/README" type="text/plain">VTIs</A>
<p class="BodyRelative">This set of demos contains sample table functions for
<ul>
	<li>making a table out of a property file</li>
	<li>making a table out of an XML file</li>
	<li>making tables out of subversion logs, apache web server logs, and
	JIRA reports.</li>
</ul>
</p><p class="BodyRelative">
In addition, this demo provides machinery for declaring and refreshing
paramaterized subscriptions to data from foreign SQL databases.
