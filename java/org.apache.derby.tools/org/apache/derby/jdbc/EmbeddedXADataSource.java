//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6552
    This data source is suitable for an application using embedded Derby,
    running on full Java SE 6 or higher, corresponding to JDBC 4.0 and higher.
    EmbeddedXADataSource is an XADataSource implementation.
    <P/>

	<P>An XADataSource is a factory for XAConnection objects.  It represents a
	RM in a DTP environment.  An object that implements the XADataSource
	interface is typically registered with a JNDI service provider.
    </P>
    
	<P>
	EmbeddedXADataSource automatically supports the correct JDBC specification version
	for the Java Virtual Machine's environment.
    </P>
    
	<UL>
    <LI>JDBC 4.0 - Java SE 6 </LI>
    <LI>JDBC 4.1 - Java SE 7</LI>
    <LI>JDBC 4.2 - full Java SE 8</LI>
	</UL>

    <P>
    Use BasicEmbeddedXADataSource40 if your application runs on Java 8
    Compact Profile 2.
    </P>

	<P>EmbeddedXADataSource object only works on a local database.  There is no
	client/server support.  An EmbeddedXADataSource object must live in the same jvm as
	the database.
    </P>

	<P>EmbeddedXADataSource is serializable and referenceable.</P>

	<P>See EmbeddedDataSource for DataSource properties.</P>

         * only implements JDBC 2 and 3), we should still return an
         * XAConnection object that *does* implement JDBC 4 because that's
         * what a JDK 6 app expects.
         *
         * By calling "findDriver()" here we will get the appropriate
         * driver for the JDK in use (ex. if using JDK 6 then findDriver()
         * will return the JDBC 4 driver).  If we then ask the driver to
         * give us an XA connection, we will get a connection that
         * corresponds to whatever driver/JDBC implementation is being
         * used--which is what we want.  So for a JDK 6 application we
         * will correctly return a JDBC 4 XAConnection. DERBY-2488.
         *
         * This type of scenario can occur if an application that was
         * previously running with an older JVM (ex. JDK 1.4/1.5) starts
         * running with a newer JVM (ex. JDK 6), in which case the app
         * is probably still using the "old" data source (ex. is still
         * instantiating EmbeddedXADataSource) instead of the newer one
         * (EmbeddedXADataSource40).
