/**
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6213
   <P>
   This is a vacuous, deprecated class. At one time, it had real behavior and helped us support
   separate datasources for Java 5 and Java 6.
   Now that we no longer support Java 5, all functionality has migrated into the superclass, EmbeddedXADataSource.
//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6213
   This class is preserved for backward compatibility reasons.
   </P>
   @deprecated Use {@link EmbeddedXADataSource} instead.
