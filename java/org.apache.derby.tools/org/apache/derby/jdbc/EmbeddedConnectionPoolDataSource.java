//IC see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6213
   <P>
    This datasource is suitable for an application using embedded Derby,
    running on full Java SE 6 and higher, corresponding to 4.0 and higher.
   EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource is a ConnectionPoolDataSource
   implementation.
    </P>
	
	<P>A ConnectionPoolDataSource is a factory for PooledConnection
	objects. An object that implements this interface will typically be
	registered with a JNDI service.</P>
    
	<P>
	EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource automatically supports the correct JDBC specification version
	for the Java Virtual Machine's environment.</P>
    
	<UL>
    <LI>JDBC 4.0 - Java SE 6</LI>
    <LI>JDBC 4.1 - Java SE 7</LI>
    <LI>JDBC 4.2 - full Java SE 8</LI>
	</UL>

    <P>
    Use BasicEmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource40 if your application runs on Java 8
    Compact Profile 2.
    </P>

	<P>EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource is serializable and referenceable.</P>

	<P>See EmbeddedDataSource for DataSource properties.</P>

         * object doesn't implement JDBC 4 (it only implements JDBC 2
         * and 3), we should still return a PooledConnection object that
         * *does* implement JDBC 4 because that's what a JDK 6 app
         * expects.
         *
         * By calling "findDriver()" here we will get the appropriate
         * driver for the JDK in use (ex. if using JDK 6 then findDriver()
         * will return the JDBC 4 driver).  If we then ask the driver to
         * give us a pooled connection, we will get a connection that
         * corresponds to whatever driver/JDBC implementation is being
         * used--which is what we want.  So for a JDK 6 application we
         * will correctly return a JDBC 4 PooledConnection. DERBY-2488.
         *
         * This type of scenario can occur if an application that was
         * previously running with an older JVM (ex. JDK 1.4/1.5) starts
         * running with a newer JVM (ex. JDK 6), in which case the app
         * is probably still using the "old" data source (ex. is still
         * instantiating EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource) instead of
         * the newer one (EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource40).
